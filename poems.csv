AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"All out of doors looked darkly in at him Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars, That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
What kept him from remembering what it was That brought him to that creaking room was age.
He stood with barrels round him—at a loss.
And having scared the cellar under him In clomping there, he scared it once again In clomping off;—and scared the outer night, Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar Of trees and crack of branches, common things, But nothing so like beating on a box.
A light he was to no one but himself Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what, A quiet light, and then not even that.
He consigned to the moon, such as she was, So late-arising, to the broken moon As better than the sun in any case For such a charge, his snow upon the roof, His icicles along the wall to keep; And slept.
The log that shifted with a jolt Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted, And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.
One aged man—one man—can't keep a house, A farm, a countryside, or if he can, It's thus he does it of a winter night.
HOME BURIAL He saw her from the bottom of the stairs Before she saw him.
She was starting down, Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.
She took a doubtful step and then undid it To raise herself and look again.
He spoke Advancing toward her: ""What is it you see From up there always—for I want to know."" She turned and sank upon her skirts at that, And her face changed from terrified to dull.
He said to gain time: ""What is it you see?"" Mounting until she cowered under him. ""I will find out now—you must tell me, dear."" She, in her place, refused him any help With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.
She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see, Blind creature; and a while he didn't see.
But at last he murmured, ""Oh,"" and again, ""Oh."" ""What is it—what?"" she said. ""Just that I see."" ""You don't,"" she challenged. ""Tell me what it is."" ""The wonder is I didn't see at once.
I never noticed it from here before.
I must be wonted to it—that's the reason.
The little graveyard where my people are!
So small the window frames the whole of it.
Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?
There are three stones of slate and one of marble, Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight On the sidehill.
We haven't to mind those.
But I understand: it is not the stones, But the child's mound——"" ""Don't, don't, don't, don't,"" she cried.
She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs; And turned on him with such a daunting look, He said twice over before he knew himself: ""Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?"" ""Not you!
Oh, where's my hat?
Oh, I don't need it!
I must get out of here.
I must get air.
I don't know rightly whether any man can."" ""Amy!
Don't go to someone else this time.
Listen to me.
I won't come down the stairs."" He sat and fixed his chin between his fists. ""There's something I should like to ask you, dear."" ""You don't know how to ask it."" ""Help me, then."" Her fingers moved the latch for all reply. ""My words are nearly always an offence.
I don't know how to speak of anything So as to please you.
But I might be taught I should suppose.
I can't say I see how.
A man must partly give up being a man With women-folk.
We could have some arrangement By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off Anything special you're a-mind to name.
Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love.
Two that don't love can't live together without them.
But two that do can't live together with them."" She moved the latch a little. ""Don't—don't go.
Don't carry it to someone else this time.
Tell me about it if it's something human.
Let me into your grief.
I'm not so much Unlike other folks as your standing there Apart would make me out.
Give me my chance.
I do think, though, you overdo it a little.
What was it brought you up to think it the thing To take your mother-loss of a first child So inconsolably—in the face of love.
You'd think his memory might be satisfied——"" ""There you go sneering now!"" ""I'm not, I'm not!
You make me angry.
I'll come down to you.
God, what a woman!
And it's come to this, A man can't speak of his own child that's dead."" ""You can't because you don't know how.
If you had any feelings, you that dug With your own hand—how could you?—his little grave; I saw you from that very window there, Making the gravel leap and leap in air, Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly And roll back down the mound beside the hole.
I thought, Who is that man?
I didn't know you.
And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs To look again, and still your spade kept lifting.
Then you came in.
I heard your rumbling voice Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why, But I went near to see with my own eyes.
You could sit there with the stains on your shoes Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave And talk about your everyday concerns.
You had stood the spade up against the wall Outside there in the entry, for I saw it."" ""I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.
I'm cursed.
God, if I don't believe I'm cursed."" ""I can repeat the very words you were saying. 'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.' Think of it, talk like that at such a time!
What had how long it takes a birch to rot To do with what was in the darkened parlour?
You couldn't care!
The nearest friends can go With anyone to death, comes so far short They might as well not try to go at all.
No, from the time when one is sick to death, One is alone, and he dies more alone.
Friends make pretence of following to the grave, But before one is in it, their minds are turned And making the best of their way back to life And living people, and things they understand.
But the world's evil.
I won't have grief so If I can change it.
Oh, I won't, I won't!"" ""There, you have said it all and you feel better.
You won't go now.
You're crying.
Close the door.
The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up?
Amy!
There's someone coming down the road!"" "" You —oh, you think the talk is all.
I must go— Somewhere out of this house.
How can I make you——"" ""If—you—do!"" She was opening the door wider. ""Where do you mean to go?
First tell me that.
I'll follow and bring you back by force.
I will! ——"" THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table Waiting for Warren.
When she heard his step, She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage To meet him in the doorway with the news And put him on his guard. ""Silas is back."" She pushed him outward with her through the door And shut it after her. ""Be kind,"" she said.
She took the market things from Warren's arms And set them on the porch, then drew him down To sit beside her on the wooden steps. ""When was I ever anything but kind to him?
But I'll not have the fellow back,"" he said. ""I told him so last haying, didn't I? 'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.' What good is he?
Who else will harbour him At his age for the little he can do?
What help he is there's no depending on.
Off he goes always when I need him most. 'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, Enough at least to buy tobacco with, So he won't have to beg and be beholden.' 'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.' 'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.' I shouldn't mind his bettering himself If that was what it was.
You can be certain, When he begins like that, there's someone at him Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,— In haying time, when any help is scarce.
In winter he comes back to us.
I'm done."" ""Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you,"" Mary said. ""I want him to: he'll have to soon or late."" ""He's worn out.
He's asleep beside the stove.
When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, A miserable sight, and frightening, too— You needn't smile—I didn't recognise him— I wasn't looking for him—and he's changed.
Wait till you see."" ""Where did you say he'd been?"" ""He didn't say.
I dragged him to the house, And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.
I tried to make him talk about his travels.
Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off."" ""What did he say?
Did he say anything?"" ""But little."" ""Anything?
Mary, confess He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me."" ""Warren!"" ""But did he?
I just want to know."" ""Of course he did.
What would you have him say?
Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man Some humble way to save his self-respect.
He added, if you really care to know, He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.
That sounds like something you have heard before?
Warren, I wish you could have heard the way He jumbled everything.
I stopped to look Two or three times—he made me feel so queer— To see if he was talking in his sleep.
He ran on Harold Wilson—you remember— The boy you had in haying four years since.
He's finished school, and teaching in his college.
Silas declares you'll have to get him back.
He says they two will make a team for work: Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!
The way he mixed that in with other things.
He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft On education—you know how they fought All through July under the blazing sun, Silas up on the cart to build the load, Harold along beside to pitch it on."" ""Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot."" ""Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.
You wouldn't think they would.
How some things linger!
Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.
After so many years he still keeps finding Good arguments he sees he might have used.
I sympathise.
I know just how it feels To think of the right thing to say too late.
Harold's associated in his mind with Latin.
He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying He studied Latin like the violin Because he liked it—that an argument!
He said he couldn't make the boy believe He could find water with a hazel prong— Which showed how much good school had ever done him.
He wanted to go over that.
But most of all He thinks if he could have another chance To teach him how to build a load of hay——"" ""I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.
He bundles every forkful in its place, And tags and numbers it for future reference, So he can find and easily dislodge it In the unloading.
Silas does that well.
He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.
You never see him standing on the hay He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself."" ""He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be Some good perhaps to someone in the world.
He hates to see a boy the fool of books.
Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, And nothing to look backward to with pride, And nothing to look forward to with hope, So now and never any different."" Part of a moon was falling down the west, Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.
Its light poured softly in her lap.
She saw And spread her apron to it.
She put out her hand Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, As if she played unheard the tenderness That wrought on him beside her in the night. ""Warren,"" she said, ""he has come home to die: You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time."" ""Home,"" he mocked gently. ""Yes, what else but home?
It all depends on what you mean by home.
Of course he's nothing to us, any more Than was the hound that came a stranger to us Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail."" ""Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in."" ""I should have called it Something you somehow haven't to deserve."" Warren leaned out and took a step or two, Picked up a little stick, and brought it back And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. ""Silas has better claim on us, you think, Than on his brother?
Thirteen little miles As the road winds would bring him to his door.
Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.
Why didn't he go there?
His brother's rich, A somebody—director in the bank."" ""He never told us that."" ""We know it though."" ""I think his brother ought to help, of course.
I'll see to that if there is need.
He ought of right To take him in, and might be willing to— He may be better than appearances.
But have some pity on Silas.
Do you think If he'd had any pride in claiming kin Or anything he looked for from his brother, He'd keep so still about him all this time?"" ""I wonder what's between them."" ""I can tell you.
Silas is what he is—we wouldn't mind him— But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.
He never did a thing so very bad.
He don't know why he isn't quite as good As anyone.
He won't be made ashamed To please his brother, worthless though he is."" "" I can't think Si ever hurt anyone."" ""No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.
He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.
You must go in and see what you can do.
I made the bed up for him there to-night.
You'll be surprised at him—how much he's broken.
His working days are done; I'm sure of it."" ""I'd not be in a hurry to say that."" ""I haven't been.
Go, look, see for yourself.
But, Warren, please remember how it is: He's come to help you ditch the meadow.
He has a plan.
You mustn't laugh at him.
He may not speak of it, and then he may.
I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud Will hit or miss the moon."" It hit the moon.
Then there were three there, making a dim row, The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.
Warren returned—too soon, it seemed to her, Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited. ""Warren,"" she questioned. ""Dead,"" was all he answered.
A SERVANT TO SERVANTS I didn't make you know how glad I was To have you come and camp here on our land.
I promised myself to get down some day And see the way you lived, but I don't know!
With a houseful of hungry men to feed I guess you'd find....
It seems to me I can't express my feelings any more Than I can raise my voice or want to lift My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).
Did ever you feel so?
I hope you never.
It's got so I don't even know for sure Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything.
There's nothing but a voice-like left inside That seems to tell me how I ought to feel, And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.
You take the lake.
I look and look at it.
I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.
I stand and make myself repeat out loud The advantages it has, so long and narrow, Like a deep piece of some old running river Cut short off at both ends.
It lies five miles Straight away through the mountain notch From the sink window where I wash the plates, And all our storms come up toward the house, Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.
It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit To step outdoors and take the water dazzle A sunny morning, or take the rising wind About my face and body and through my wrapper, When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den, And a cold chill shivered across the lake.
I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water, Our Willoughby!
How did you hear of it?
I expect, though, everyone's heard of it.
In a book about ferns?
Listen to that!
You let things more like feathers regulate Your going and coming.
And you like it here?
I can see how you might.
But I don't know!
It would be different if more people came, For then there would be business.
As it is, The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them, Sometimes we don't.
We've a good piece of shore That ought to be worth something, and may yet.
But I don't count on it as much as Len.
He looks on the bright side of everything, Including me.
He thinks I'll be all right With doctoring.
But it's not medicine— Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so— It's rest I want—there, I have said it out— From cooking meals for hungry hired men And washing dishes after them—from doing Things over and over that just won't stay done.
By good rights I ought not to have so much Put on me, but there seems no other way.
Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.
He says the best way out is always through.
And I agree to that, or in so far As that I can see no way out but through— Leastways for me—and then they'll be convinced.
It's not that Len don't want the best for me.
It was his plan our moving over in Beside the lake from where that day I showed you We used to live—ten miles from anywhere We didn't change without some sacrifice, But Len went at it to make up the loss.
His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun, But he works when he works as hard as I do— Though there's small profit in comparisons. (Women and men will make them all the same.) But work ain't all.
Len undertakes too much.
He's into everything in town.
This year It's highways, and he's got too many men Around him to look after that make waste.
They take advantage of him shamefully, And proud, too, of themselves for doing so.
We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings, Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk While I fry their bacon.
Much they care!
No more put out in what they do or say Than if I wasn't in the room at all.
Coming and going all the time, they are: I don't learn what their names are, let alone Their characters, or whether they are safe To have inside the house with doors unlocked.
I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not Afraid of me.
There's two can play at that.
I have my fancies: it runs in the family.
My father's brother wasn't right.
They kept him Locked up for years back there at the old farm.
I've been away once—yes, I've been away.
The State Asylum.
I was prejudiced; I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there; You know the old idea—the only asylum Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford, Rather than send their folks to such a place, Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.
But it's not so: the place is the asylum.
There they have every means proper to do with, And you aren't darkening other people's lives— Worse than no good to them, and they no good To you in your condition; you can't know Affection or the want of it in that state.
I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.
My father's brother, he went mad quite young.
Some thought he had been bitten by a dog, Because his violence took on the form Of carrying his pillow in his teeth; But it's more likely he was crossed in love, Or so the story goes.
It was some girl.
Anyway, all he talked about was love.
They soon saw he would do someone a mischief If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended In father's building him a sort of cage, Or room within a room, of hickory poles, Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,— A narrow passage all the way around.
Anything they put in for furniture He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.
So they made the place comfortable with straw, Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.
Of course they had to feed him without dishes.
They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded With his clothes on his arm—all of his clothes.
Cruel—it sounds.
I s'pose they did the best They knew.
And just when he was at the height, Father and mother married, and mother came, A bride, to help take care of such a creature, And accommodate her young life to his.
That was what marrying father meant to her.
She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful By his shouts in the night.
He'd shout and shout Until the strength was shouted out of him, And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.
He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string, And let them go and make them twang until His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.
And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play— The only fun he had.
I've heard them say, though, They found a way to put a stop to it.
He was before my time—I never saw him; But the pen stayed exactly as it was There in the upper chamber in the ell, A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.
I often think of the smooth hickory bars.
It got so I would say—you know, half fooling— ""It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail""— Just as you will till it becomes a habit.
No wonder I was glad to get away.
Mind you, I waited till Len said the word.
I didn't want the blame if things went wrong.
I was glad though, no end, when we moved out, And I looked to be happy, and I was, As I said, for a while—but I don't know!
Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.
And there's more to it than just window-views And living by a lake.
I'm past such help— Unless Len took the notion, which he won't, And I won't ask him—it's not sure enough.
I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going: Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I?
I almost think if I could do like you, Drop everything and live out on the ground— But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it, Or a long rain.
I should soon get enough, And be glad of a good roof overhead.
I've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant, More than you have yourself, some of these nights.
The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away From over you as you lay in your beds.
I haven't courage for a risk like that.
Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work, But the thing of it is, I need to be kept.
There's work enough to do—there's always that; But behind's behind.
The worst that you can do Is set me back a little more behind.
I shan't catch up in this world, anyway.
I'd rather you'd not go unless you must.
THE SELF-SEEKER ""Willis, I didn't want you here to-day: The lawyer's coming for the company.
I'm going to sell my soul, or, rather, feet.
Five hundred dollars for the pair, you know."" ""With you the feet have nearly been the soul; And if you're going to sell them to the devil, I want to see you do it.
When's he coming?"" ""I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose To try to help me drive a better bargain."" ""Well, if it's true!
Yours are no common feet.
The lawyer don't know what it is he's buying: So many miles you might have walked you won't walk.
You haven't run your forty orchids down.
What does he think?—How are the blessed feet?
The doctor's sure you're going to walk again?"" ""He thinks I'll hobble.
It's both legs and feet."" ""They must be terrible—I mean to look at."" ""I haven't dared to look at them uncovered.
Through the bed blankets I remind myself Of a starfish laid out with rigid points."" ""The wonder is it hadn't been your head."" ""It's hard to tell you how I managed it.
When I saw the shaft had me by the coat, I didn't try too long to pull away, Or fumble for my knife to cut away, I just embraced the shaft and rode it out— Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit.
That's how I think I didn't lose my head, But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling."" ""Awful.
Why didn't they throw off the belt Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?"" ""They say sometime was wasted on the belt— Old streak of leather—doesn't love me much Because I made him spit fire at my knuckles, The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string.
That must be it.
Some days he won't stay on.
That day a woman couldn't coax him off.
He's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys.
Everything goes the same without me there.
You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw Caterwaul to the hills around the village As they both bite the wood.
It's all our music.
One ought as a good villager to like it.
No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound, And it's our life."" ""Yes, when it's not our death."" ""You make that sound as if it wasn't so With everything.
What we live by we die by.
I wonder where my lawyer is.
His train's in.
I want this over with; I'm hot and tired."" ""You're getting ready to do something foolish."" ""Watch for him, will you, Will?
You let him in.
I'd rather Mrs.
Corbin didn't know; I've boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me.
You're bad enough to manage without her."" ""And I'm going to be worse instead of better.
You've got to tell me how far this is gone: Have you agreed to any price?"" ""Five hundred.
Five hundred—five—five!
One, two, three, four, five.
You needn't look at me."" ""I don't believe you."" ""I told you, Willis, when you first came in.
Don't you be hard on me.
I have to take What I can get.
You see they have the feet, Which gives them the advantage in the trade.
I can't get back the feet in any case."" ""But your flowers, man, you're selling out your flowers."" ""Yes, that's one way to put it—all the flowers Of every kind everywhere in this region For the next forty summers—call it forty.
But I'm not selling those, I'm giving them, They never earned me so much as one cent: Money can't pay me for the loss of them.
No, the five hundred was the sum they named To pay the doctor's bill and tide me over.
It's that or fight, and I don't want to fight— I just want to get settled in my life, Such as it's going to be, and know the worst, Or best—it may not be so bad.
The firm Promise me all the shooks I want to nail."" ""But what about your flora of the valley?"" ""You have me there.
But that—you didn't think That was worth money to me?
Still, I own It goes against me not to finish it For the friends it might bring me.
By the way, I had a letter from Burroughs—did I tell you?— About my Cyprepedium reginœ ; He says it's not reported so far north.
There! there's the bell.
He's rung.
But you go down And bring him up, and don't let Mrs.
Corbin.— Oh, well, we'll soon be through with it.
I'm tired."" Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer A little barefoot girl who in the noise Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house, And baritone importance of the lawyer, Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands Shyly behind her. ""Well, and how is Mister—"" The lawyer was already in his satchel As if for papers that might bear the name He hadn't at command. ""You must excuse me, I dropped in at the mill and was detained."" ""Looking round, I suppose,"" said Willis. ""Yes, Well, yes."" ""Hear anything that might prove useful?"" The Broken One saw Anne. ""Why, here is Anne What do you want, dear?
Come, stand by the bed; Tell me what is it?"" Anne just wagged her dress With both hands held behind her. ""Guess,"" she said. ""Oh, guess which hand?
My, my!
Once on a time I knew a lovely way to tell for certain By looking in the ears.
But I forget it.
Er, let me see.
I think I'll take the right.
That's sure to be right even if it's wrong.
Come, hold it out.
Don't change.—A Ram's Horn orchid!
A Ram's Horn!
What would I have got, I wonder, If I had chosen left.
Hold out the left.
Another Ram's Horn!
Where did you find those, Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?"" Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side, And thought she wouldn't venture on so much. ""Were there no others?"" ""There were four or five.
I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all."" ""I wouldn't—so I wouldn't.
You're the girl!
You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart."" ""I wanted there should be some there next year."" ""Of course you did.
You left the rest for seed, And for the backwoods woodchuck.
You're the girl!
A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck Sounds something like.
Better than farmer's beans To a discriminating appetite, Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had In bushel lots—doesn't come on the market.
But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all?
You're hiding something.
That's as bad as lying.
You ask this lawyer man.
And it's not safe With a lawyer at hand to find you out.
Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne.
You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper.
What did I tell you?
What?
I'd blush, I would.
Don't you defend yourself.
If it was there, Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?"" ""Well, wait—it's common—it's too common. "" ""Common?
The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner."" ""I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper To You —to you I mean—they're both too common."" The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers As if with some idea that she had scored. ""I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets.
It's not fair to the child.
It can't be helped though: Pressed into service means pressed out of shape.
Somehow I'll make it right with her—she'll see.
She's going to do my scouting in the field, Over stone walls and all along a wood And by a river bank for water flowers, The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, And at the sinus under water a fist Of little fingers all kept down but one, And that thrust up to blossom in the sun As if to say 'You!
You're the Heart's desire.' Anne has a way with flowers to take the place Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee And lifts their faces by the chin to hers And says their names, and leaves them where they are."" The lawyer wore a watch the case of which Was cunningly devised to make a noise Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut At such a time as this.
He snapped it now. ""Well, Anne, go, dearie.
Our affair will wait.
The lawyer man is thinking of his train.
He wants to give me lots and lots of money Before he goes, because I hurt myself, And it may take him I don't know how long.
But put our flowers in water first.
Will, help her: The pitcher's too full for her.
There's no cup?
Just hook them on the inside of the pitcher.
Now run.—Get out your documents!
You see I have to keep on the good side of Anne.
I'm a great boy to think of number one.
And you can't blame me in the place I'm in.
Who will take care of my necessities Unless I do?"" ""A pretty interlude,"" The lawyer said: ""I'm sorry, but my train—— Luckily terms are all agreed upon.
You only have to sign your name.
Right—there."" ""You, Will, stop making faces.
Come round here Where you can't make them.
What is it you want?
I'll put you out with Anne.
Be good or go."" ""You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?"" ""Make yourself useful then, and read it for me.
Isn't it something I have seen before?"" ""You'll find it is.
Let your friend look at it."" ""Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much In haste to get it over with as you.
But read it, read it.
That's right, draw the curtain: Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.— What do you say, Will?
Don't you be a fool.
You! crumpling folkses' legal documents.
Out with it if you've any real objection."" ""Five hundred dollars!"" ""What would you think right?"" ""A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; You know it, Mr.
Lawyer.
The sin is Accepting anything before he knows Whether he's ever going to walk again.
It smells to me like a dishonest trick."" ""I think—I think—from what I heard to-day— And saw myself—he would be ill-advised——"" ""What did you hear, for instance?"" Willis said. ""Now the place where the accident occurred——"" The Broken One was twisted in his bed. ""This is between you two apparently.
Where I come in is what I want to know.
You stand up to it like a pair of cocks.
Go outdoors if you want to fight.
Spare me.
When you come back, I'll have the papers signed.
Will pencil do?
Then, please, your fountain pen.
One of you hold my head up from the pillow."" Willis flung off the bed. ""I wash my hands— I'm no match—no, and don't pretend to be——"" The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. ""You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it.
We're very sorry for you."" Willis sneered: ""Who's we? —some stockholders in Boston?
I'll go outdoors, by gad! and won't come back."" ""Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come.
Yes.
Thanks for caring.
Don't mind Will: he's savage.
He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers.
You don't know what I mean about the flowers.
Don't stop to try now.
You'll miss your train.
Good-bye."" He flung his arms around his face.
THE HILL WIFE LONELINESS ( Her Word ) One ought not to have to care So much as you and I Care when the birds come round the house To seem to say good-bye; Or care so much when they come back With whatever it is they sing; The truth being we are as much Too glad for the one thing As we are too sad for the other here— With birds that fill their breasts But with each other and themselves And their built or driven nests.
HOUSE FEAR Always—I tell you this they learned— Always at night when they returned To the lonely house from far away To lamps unlighted and fire gone gray, They learned to rattle the lock and key To give whatever might chance to be Warning and time to be off in flight: And preferring the out- to the in-door night, They learned to leave the house-door wide Until they had lit the lamp inside.
THE SMILE ( Her Word ) I didn't like the way he went away.
That smile!
It never came of being gay.
Still, he smiled—did you see him?—I was sure!
Perhaps because we gave him only bread And the wretch knew from that that we were poor.
Perhaps because he let us give instead Of seizing from us as he might have seized.
Perhaps he mocked at us for being wed, Or being very young (and he was pleased To have a vision of us old and dead).
I wonder how far down the road he's got.
He's watching from the woods as like as not.
THE OFT-REPEATED DREAM She had no saying dark enough For the dark pine that kept Forever trying the window-latch Of the room where they slept.
The tireless but ineffectual hands That with every futile pass Made the great tree seem as a little bird Before the mystery of glass!
It never had been inside the room, And only one of the two Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream Of what the tree might do.
THE IMPULSE It was too lonely for her there, And too wild, And since there were but two of them, And no child, And work was little in the house, She was free, And followed where he furrowed field, Or felled tree.
She rested on a log and tossed The fresh chips, With a song only to herself On her lips.
And once she went to break a bough Of black alder.
She strayed so far she scarcely heard When he called her— And didn't answer—didn't speak— Or return.
She stood, and then she ran and hid In the fern.
He never found her, though he looked Everywhere, And he asked at her mother's house Was she there.
Sudden and swift and light as that The ties gave, And he learned of finalities Besides the grave.
OUT, OUT....
The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood, Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.
And from there those that lifted eyes could count Five mountain ranges one behind the other Under the sunset far into Vermont.
And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, As it ran light, or had to bear a load.
And nothing happened: day was all but done.
Call it a day, I wish they might have said To please the boy by giving him the half hour That a boy counts so much when saved from work.
His sister stood beside them in her apron To tell them ""Supper."" At the word, the saw, As if to prove saws knew what supper meant, Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap— He must have given the hand.
However it was, Neither refused the meeting.
But the hand!
The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh.
As he swung toward them holding up the hand Half in appeal, but half as if to keep The life from spilling.
Then the boy saw all— Since he was old enough to know, big boy Doing a man's work, though a child at heart— He saw all spoiled. ""Don't let him cut my hand of— The doctor, when he comes.
Don't let him, sister!"" So.
But the hand was gone already.
The doctor put him in the dark of ether.
He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.
And then—the watcher at his pulse took fright.
No one believed.
They listened at his heart.
Little—less—nothing!—and that ended it.
No more to build on there.
And they, since they Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs."
PUTTING IN THE SEED ,"You come to fetch me from my work to-night When supper's on the table, and we'll see If I can leave off burying the white Soft petals fallen from the apple tree (Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite, Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea); And go along with you ere you lose sight Of what you came for and become like me, Slave to a springtime passion for the earth.
How Love bums through the Putting in the Seed On through the watching for that early birth When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed, The sturdy seedling with arched body comes Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs.
GOING FOR WATER The well was dry beside the door, And so we went with pail and can Across the fields behind the house To seek the brook if still it ran; Not loth to have excuse to go, Because the autumn eve was fair (Though chill), because the fields were ours, And by the brook our woods were there.
We ran as if to meet the moon That slowly dawned behind the trees, The barren boughs without the leaves, Without the birds, without the breeze.
But once within the wood, we paused Like gnomes that hid us from the moon, Ready to run to hiding new With laughter when she found us soon.
Each laid on other a staying hand To listen ere we dared to look, And in the hush we joined to make We heard, we knew we heard the brook.
A note as from a single place, A slender tinkling fall that made Now drops that floated on the pool Like pearls, and now a silver blade.
MOWING There was never a sound beside the wood but one, And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.
What was it it whispered?
I knew not well myself; Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound— And that was why it whispered and did not speak.
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours, Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf: Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows, Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers (Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.
The fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows.
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make."
AFTER APPLE-PICKING ,"My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree Toward heaven still, And there's a barrel that I didn't fill Beside it, and there may be two or three Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night, The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight I got from looking through a pane of glass I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough And held against the world of hoary grass.
It melted, and I let it fall and break.
But I was well Upon my way to sleep before it fell, And I could tell What form my dreaming was about to take.
Magnified apples appear and disappear, Stem end and blossom end, And every fleck of russet showing clear.
My instep arch not only keeps the ache, It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin The rumbling sound Of load on load of apples coming in.
For I have had too much Of apple-picking: I am overtired Of the great harvest I myself desired.
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.
For all That struck the earth, No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble, Went surely to the cider-apple heap As of no worth.
One can see what will trouble This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.
Were he not gone, The woodchuck could say whether it's like his Long sleep, as I describe its coming on, Or just some human sleep.
BIRCHES When I see birches bend to left and right Across the lines of straighter darker trees, I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that.
Often you must have seen them Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning After a rain.
They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed So low for long, they never right themselves: You may see their trunks arching in the woods Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground, Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
But I was going to say when Truth broke in With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm, I should prefer to have some boy bend them As he went out and in to fetch the cows— Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, Whose only play was what he found himself, Summer or winter, and could play alone.
One by one he subdued his father's trees By riding them down over and over again Until he took the stiffness out of them, And not one but hung limp, not one was left For him to conquer.
He learned all there was To learn about not launching out too soon And so not carrying the tree away Clear to the ground.
He always kept his poise To the top branches, climbing carefully With the same pains you use to fill a cup Up to the brim, and even above the brim.
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.
And so I dream of going back to be.
It's when I'm weary of considerations, And life is too much like a pathless wood Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs Broken across it, and one eye is weeping From a twig's having lashed across it open.
I'd like to get away from earth awhile And then come back to it and begin over.
May no fate wilfully misunderstand me And half grant what I wish and snatch me away Not to return.
Earth's the right place for love: I don't know where it's likely to go better.
I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree, And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, But dipped its top and set me down again.
That would be good both going and coming back.
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.
THE GUM-GATHERER There overtook me and drew me in To his down-hill, early-morning stride, And set me five miles on my road Better than if he had had me ride, A man with a swinging bag for load And half the bag wound round his hand.
We talked like barking above the din Of water we walked along beside.
And for my telling him where I'd been And where I lived in mountain land To be coming home the way I was, He told me a little about himself.
He came from higher up in the pass Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks Is blocks split off the mountain mass— And hopeless grist enough it looks Ever to grind to soil for grass. (The way it is will do for moss.) There he had built his stolen shack.
It had to be a stolen shack Because of the fears of fire and loss That trouble the sleep of lumber folk: Visions of half the world burned black And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.
We know who when they come to town Bring berries under the wagon seat, Or a basket of eggs between their feet; What this man brought in a cotton sack Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce.
He showed me lumps of the scented stuff Like uncut jewels, dull and rough.
It comes to market golden brown; But turns to pink between the teeth.
I told him this is a pleasant life To set your breast to the bark of trees That all your days are dim beneath, And reaching up with a little knife, To loose the resin and take it down And bring it to market when you please.
THE MOUNTAIN The mountain held the town as in a shadow.
I saw so much before I slept there once: I noticed that I missed stars in the west, Where its black body cut into the sky.
Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall Behind which I was sheltered from a wind.
And yet between the town and it I found, When I walked forth at dawn to see new things, Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields.
The river at the time was fallen away, And made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones; But the signs showed what it had done in spring; Good grass-land gullied out, and in the grass Ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark.
I crossed the river and swung round the mountain.
And there I met a man who moved so slow With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart, It seemed no harm to stop him altogether. ""What town is this?"" I asked. ""This?
Lunenburg."" Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn, Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain, But only felt at night its shadowy presence. ""Where is your village?
Very far from here?"" ""There is no village—only scattered farms.
We were but sixty voters last election.
We can't in nature grow to many more: That thing takes all the room!"" He moved his goad.
The mountain stood there to be pointed at.
Pasture ran up the side a little way, And then there was a wall of trees with trunks: After that only tops of trees, and cliffs Imperfectly concealed among the leaves.
A dry ravine emerged from under boughs Into the pasture. ""That looks like a path.
Is that the way to reach the top from here?— Not for this morning, but some other time: I must be getting back to breakfast now."" ""I don't advise your trying from this side.
There is no proper path, but those that have Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's.
That's five miles back.
You can't mistake the place: They logged it there last winter some way up.
I'd take you, but I'm bound the other way."" ""You've never climbed it?"" ""I've been on the sides Deer-hunting and trout-fishing.
There's a brook That starts up on it somewhere—I've heard say Right on the top, tip-top—a curious thing.
But what would interest you about the brook, It's always cold in summer, warm in winter.
One of the great sights going is to see It steam in winter like an ox's breath.
Until the bushes all along its banks Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles— You know the kind.
Then let the sun shine on it!"" ""There ought to be a view around the world From such a mountain—if it isn't wooded Clear to the top."" I saw through leafy screens Great granite terraces in sun and shadow, Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up— With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet; Or turn and sit on and look out and down, With little ferns in crevices at his elbow.v ""As to that I can't say.
But there's the spring, Right on the summit, almost like a fountain.
That ought to be worth seeing."" ""If it's there.
You never saw it?"" ""I guess there's no doubt About its being there.
I never saw it.
It may not be right on the very top: It wouldn't have to be a long way down To have some head of water from above, And a good distance down might not be noticed By anyone who'd come a long way up.
One time I asked a fellow climbing it To look and tell me later how it was."" ""What did he say?"" ""He said there was a lake Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top."" ""But a lake's different.
What about the spring?"" ""He never got up high enough to see.
That's why I don't advise your trying this side.
He tried this side.
I've always meant to go And look myself, but you know how it is: It doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain You've worked around the foot of all your life.
What would I do?
Go in my overalls, With a big stick, the same as when the cows Haven't come down to the bars at milking time?
Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear? 'Twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it."" ""I shouldn't climb it if I didn't want to— Not for the sake of climbing.
What's its name?"" ""We call it Hor: I don't know if that's right."" ""Can one walk round it?
Would it be too far?"" ""You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg, But it's as much as ever you can do, The boundary lines keep in so close to it.
Hor is the township, and the township's Hor— And a few houses sprinkled round the foot, Like boulders broken off the upper cliff, Rolled out a little farther than the rest."" ""Warm in December, cold in June, you say?"" ""I don't suppose the waters changed at all.
You and I know enough to know it's warm Compared with cold, and cold compared with warm.
But all the fun's in how you say a thing."" ""You've lived here all your life?"" ""Ever since Hor Was no bigger than a——"" What, I did not hear.
He drew the oxen toward him with light touches Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank, Gave them their marching orders, and was moving.
THE TUFT OF FLOWERS I went to turn the grass once after one Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.
The dew was gone that made his blade so keen Before I came to view the levelled scene.
I looked for him behind an isle of trees; I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.
But he had gone his way, the grass all mown, And I must be, as he had been—alone, ""As all must be,"" I said within my heart, ""Whether they work together or apart."" But as I said it, swift there passed me by On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly, Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night Some resting flower of yesterday's delight.
And once I marked his flight go round and round, As where some flower lay withering on the ground.
And then he flew as far as eye could see, And then on tremulous wing came back to me.
I thought of questions that have no reply, And would have turned to toss the grass to dry; But he turned first, and led my eye to look At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.
I left my place to know them by their name, Finding them butterfly weed when I came.
The mower in the dew had loved them thus, By leaving them to flourish, not for us, Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him.
But from sheer morning gladness at the brim.
The butterfly and I had lit upon, Nevertheless, a message from the dawn.
That made me hear the wakening birds around, And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground, And feel a spirit kindred to my own; So that henceforth I worked no more alone; But glad with him, I worked as with his aid, And weary, sought at noon with him the shade; And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach. ""Men work together,"" I told him from the heart, ""Whether they work together or apart."" MENDING WALL Something there is that doesn't love a wall, That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, And spills the upper boulders in the sun; And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping dogs.
The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there.
I let my neighbour know beyond the hill; And on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again.
We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls We have to use a spell to make them balance: ""Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"" We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of out-door game, One on a side.
It comes to little more: There where it is we do not need the wall: He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
My apple trees will never get across And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, ""Good fences make good neighbours."" Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder If I could put a notion in his head: "" Why do they make good neighbours?
Isn't it Where there are cows?
But here there are no cows.
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know What I was walling in or walling out, And to whom I was like to give offence.
Something there is that doesn't love a wall, That wants it down."" I could say ""Elves"" to him, But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather He said it for himself.
I see him there Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
He moves in darkness as it seems to me, Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
He will not go behind his father's saying, And he likes having thought of it so well He says again, ""Good fences make good neighbours."" AN ENCOUNTER Once on the kind of day called ""weather breeder,"" When the heat slowly hazes and the sun By its own power seems to be undone, I was half boring through, half climbing through, A swamp of cedar.
Choked with oil of cedar And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated, And sorry I ever left the road I knew, I paused and rested on a sort of hook That had me by the coat as good as seated, And since there was no other way to look, Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue Stood over me a resurrected tree, A tree that had been down and raised again— A barkless spectre.
He had halted too, As if for fear of treading upon me.
I saw the strange position of his hands— Up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands Of wire with something in it from men to men. ""You here?"" I said. ""Where aren't you nowadays?
And what's the news you carry—if you know?
And tell me where you're off for—Montreal?
Me?
I'm not off for anywhere at all.
Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways Half looking for the orchid Calypso."" THE WOOD-PILE Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day I paused and said, ""I will turn back from here.
No, I will go on farther—and we shall see."" The hard snow held me, save where now and then One foot went through.
The view was all in lines Straight up and down of tall slim trees Too much alike to mark or name a place by So as to say for certain I was here Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.
A small bird flew before me.
He was careful To put a tree between us when he lighted, And say no word to tell me who he was Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.
He thought that I was after him for a feather— The white one in his tail; like one who takes Everything said as personal to himself.
One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.
And then there was a pile of wood for which I forgot him and let his little fear Carry him off the way I might have gone, Without so much as wishing him good-night.
He went behind it to make his last stand.
It was a cord of maple, cut and split And piled—and measured, four by four by eight.
And not another like it could I see.
No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.
And it was older sure than this year's cutting, Or even last year's or the year's before.
The wood was gray and the bark warping off it And the pile somewhat sunken.
Clematis Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.
What held it though on one side was a tree Still growing, and on one a stake and prop, These latter about to fall.
I thought that only Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks Could so forget his handiwork on which He spent himself, the labour of his axe, And leave it there far from a useful fireplace To warm the frozen swamp as best it could With the slow smokeless burning of decay."
SNOW,"The three stood listening to a fresh access Of wind that caught against the house a moment, Gulped snow, and then blew free again—the Coles Dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep, Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.
Meserve was first to speak.
He pointed backward Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying, ""You can just see it glancing off the roof Making a great scroll upward toward the sky, Long enough for recording all our names on; I think I'll just call up my wife and tell her I'm here—so far—and starting on again.
I'll call her softly so that if she's wise And gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer."" Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened. ""Why, Lett, still up?
Lett, I'm at Cole's.
I'm late.
I called you up to say Good-night from here Before I went to say Good-morning there.— I thought I would.—I know, but, Lett—I know— I could, but what's the sense?
The rest won't be So bad.—Give me an hour for it.—Ho, ho!
Three hours to here!
But that was all up hill; The rest is down.—Why, no, no, not a wallow: They kept their heads and took their time to it Like darlings, both of them.
They're in the barn.— My dear, I'm coming just the same.
I didn't Call you to ask you to invite me home.—"" He lingered for some word she wouldn't say, Said it at last himself, ""Good-night,"" and then, Getting no answer, closed the telephone.
The three stood in the lamplight round the table With lowered eyes a moment till he said, ""I'll just see how the horses are."" ""Yes, do,"" Both the Coles said together.
Mrs.
Cole Added: ""You can judge better after seeing.— I want you here with me, Fred.
Leave him here, Brother Meserve.
You know to find your way Out through the shed."" ""I guess I know my way, I guess I know where I can find my name Carved in the shed to tell me who I am If it don't tell me where I am.
I used To play——"" ""You tend your horses and come back.
Fred Cole, you're going to let him!"" ""Well, aren't you?
How can you help yourself?"" ""I called him Brother.
Why did I call him that?"" ""It's right enough.
That's all you ever heard him called round here.
He seems to have lost off his Christian name."" ""Christian enough I should call that myself.
He took no notice, did he?
Well, at least I didn't use it out of love of him, The dear knows.
I detest the thought of him With his ten children under ten years old.
I hate his wretched little Racker Sect, All's ever I heard of it, which isn't much.
But that's not saying——Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve, Isn't it, now?
He's been here half an hour.
He says he left the village store at nine.
Three hours to do four miles—a mile an hour Or not much better.
Why, it doesn't seem As if a man could move that slow and move.
Try to think what he did with all that time.
And three miles more to go!"" ""Don't let him go.
Stick to him, Helen.
Make him answer you.
That sort of man talks straight on all his life From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf To anything anyone else may say.
I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you."" ""What is he doing out a night like this?
Why can't he stay at home?"" ""He had to preach."" ""It's no night to be out."" ""He may be small, He may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough."" ""And strong of stale tobacco."" ""He'll pull through."" ""You only say so.
Not another house Or shelter to put into from this place To theirs.
I'm going to call his wife again."" ""Wait and he may.
Let's see what he will do.
Let's see if he will think of her again.
But then I doubt he's thinking of himself.
He doesn't look on it as anything."" ""He shan't go—there!"" ""It is a night, my dear."" ""One thing: he dicing drag God into it."" ""He don't consider it a case for God."" ""You think so, do you?
You don't know the kind.
He's getting up a miracle this minute.
Privately—to himself, right now, he's thinking He'll make a case of it if he succeeds, But keep still if he fails."" ""Keep still all over.
He'll be dead—dead and buried."" ""Such a trouble!
Not but I've every reason not to care What happens to him if it only takes Some of the sanctimonious conceit Out of one of those pious scalawags."" ""Nonsense to that!
You want to see him safe."" ""You like the runt."" ""Don't you a little?"" ""Well, I don't like what he's doing, which is what You like, and like him for."" ""Oh, yes, you do.
You like your fun as well as anyone; Only you women have to put these airs on To impress men.
You've got us so ashamed Of being men we can't look at a good fight Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it.
Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.— He's here.
I leave him all to you.
Go in And save his life.—All right, come in, Meserve Sit down, sit down.
How did you find the horses?"" ""Fine, fine."" ""And ready for some more?
My wife here Says it won't do.
You've got to give it up."" ""Won't you to please me?
Please!
If I say please?
Mr.
Meserve, I'll leave it to your wife.
What did your wife say on the telephone?"" Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp Or something not far from it on the table.
By straightening out and lifting a forefinger, He pointed with his hand from where it lay Like a white crumpled spider on his knee: ""That leaf there in your open book!
It moved Just then, I thought.
It's stood erect like that, There on the table, ever since I came, Trying to turn itself backward or forward, I've had my eye on it to make out which; If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience— You see I know—to get you on to things It wants to see how you will take, if backward It's from regret for something you have passed And failed to see the good of.
Never mind, Things must expect to come in front of us A many times—I don't say just how many— That varies with the things—before we see them.
One of the lies would make it out that nothing Ever presents itself before us twice.
Where would we be at last if that were so?
Our very life depends on everything's Recurring till we answer from within.
The thousandth time may prove the charm.—That leaf!
It can't turn either way.
It needs the wind's help.
But the wind didn't move it if it moved.
It moved itself.
The wind's at naught in here.
It couldn't stir so sensitively poised A thing as that.
It couldn't reach the lamp To get a puff of black smoke from the flame, Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat.
You make a little foursquare block of air, Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all The illimitable dark and cold and storm, And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog, And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose; Though for all anyone can tell, repose May be the thing you haven't, yet you give it.
So false it is that what we haven't we can't give; So false, that what we always say is true.
I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.
It won't lie down.
Then let it stand.
Who cares?"" ""I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve, But if you're going—Say you'll stay, you know?
But let me raise this curtain on a scene, And show you how it's piling up against you.
You see the snow-white through the white of frost?
Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbed Since last we read the gage."" ""It looks as if Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat And its eyes shut with overeagerness To see what people found so interesting In one another, and had gone to sleep Of its own stupid lack of understanding, Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff Short off, and died against the window-pane."" ""Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself More than you will us with such nightmare talk.
It's you it matters to, because it's you Who have to go out into it alone."" ""Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay."" ""Before you drop the curtain—I'm reminded: You recollect the boy who came out here To breathe the air one winter—had a room Down at the Averys'?
Well, one sunny morning After a downy storm, he passed our place And found me banking up the house with snow.
And I was burrowing in deep for warmth, Piling it well above the window-sills.
The snow against the window caught his eye. 'Hey, that's a pretty thought'—those were his words. 'So you can think it's six feet deep outside, While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.
You can't get too much winter in the winter.' Those were his words.
And he went home and all But banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.
Now you and I would go to no such length.
At the same time you can't deny it makes It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three, Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run So high across the pane outside.
There where There is a sort of tunnel in the frost More like a tunnel than a hole—way down At the far end of it you see a stir And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift Blown in the wind.
I like that—I like that.
Well, now I leave you, people."" ""Come, Meserve, We thought you were deciding not to go— The ways you found to say the praise of comfort And being where you are.
You want to stay."" ""I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow.
This house is frozen brittle, all except This room you sit in.
If you think the wind Sounds further off, it's not because it's dying; You're further under in the snow—that's all— And feel it less.
Hear the soft bombs of dust It bursts against us at the chimney mouth, And at the eaves.
I like it from inside More than I shall out in it.
But the horses Are rested and it's time to say good-night, And let you get to bed again.
Good-night, Sorry I had to break in on your sleep."" ""Lucky for you you did.
Lucky for you You had us for a half-way station To stop at.
If you were the kind of man Paid heed to women, you'd take my advice And for your family's sake stay where you are.
But what good is my saying it over and over?
You've done more than you had a right to think You could do— now.
You know the risk you take In going on."" ""Our snow-storms as a rule Aren't looked on as man-killers, and although I'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep Under it all, his door sealed up and lost, Than the man fighting it to keep above it, Yet think of the small birds at roost and not In nests.
Shall I be counted less than they are?
Their bulk in water would be frozen rock In no time out to-night.
And yet to-morrow They will come budding boughs from tree to tree Flirting their wings and saying Chickadee, As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm."" ""But why when no one wants you to go on?
Your wife—she doesn't want you to.
We don't, And you yourself don't want to.
Who else is there?"" ""Save us from being cornered by a woman.
Well, there's""—She told Fred afterward that in The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word Was coming, ""God."" But no, he only said ""Well, there's—the storm.
That says I must go on.
That wants me as a war might if it came.
Ask any man."" He threw her that as something To last her till he got outside the door.
He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.
When Cole returned he found his wife still standing Beside the table near the open book, Not reading it. ""Well, what kind of a man Do you call that?"" she said. ""He had the gift Of words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?"" ""Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?"" ""Or disregarding peopled civil questions— What?
We've found out in one hour more about him Than we had seeing him pass by in the road A thousand times.
If that's the way he preaches!
You didn't think you'd keep him after all.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.
He didn't leave you Much say in the matter, and I'm just as glad We're not in for a night of him.
No sleep If he had stayed.
The least thing set him going.
It's quiet as an empty church without him."" ""But how much better off are we as it is?
We'll have to sit here till we know he's safe."" ""Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't.
He knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try.
Get into bed I say, and get some rest.
He won't come back, and if he telephones, It won't be for an hour or two."" ""Well then We can't be any help by sitting here And living his fight through with him, I suppose. * * * Cole had been telephoning in the dark.
Mrs.
Cole's voice came from an inner room: ""Did she call you or you call her?"" ""She me.
You'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.
We must have been asleep: it's three and after."" ""Had she been ringing long?
I'll get my wrapper.
I want to speak to her."" ""All she said was, He hadn't come and had he really started."" ""She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago. ""He had the shovel.
Hell have made a fight."" ""Why did I ever let him leave this house!"" ""Don't begin that.
You did the best you could To keep him—though perhaps you didn't quite Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk To disobey you.
Much his wife'll thank you."" ""Fred, after all I said!
You shan't make out That it was any way but what it was.
Did she let on by any word she said She didn't thank me?"" ""When I told her 'Gone,' 'Well then,' she said, and 'Well then'—like a threat.
And then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh, you, Why did you let him go'?"" ""Asked why we let him?
You let me there.
I'll ask her why she let him.
She didn't dare to speak when he was here.
Their number's—twenty-one?
The thing won't work.
Someone's receiver's down.
The handle stumbles.
The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!
It's theirs.
She's dropped it from her hand and gone."" ""Try speaking.
Say 'Hello'!"" ""Hello, Hello."" ""What do you hear?"" ""I hear an empty room— You know—it sounds that way.
And yes, I hear— I think I hear a clock—and windows rattling.
No step though.
If she's there she's sitting down."" ""Shout, she may hear you."" ""Shouting is no good."" ""Keep speaking then."" ""Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
You don't suppose—?
She wouldn't go out doors?"" ""I'm half afraid that's just what she might do."" ""And leave the children?"" ""Wait and call again.
You can't hear whether she has left the door Wide open and the wind's blown out the lamp And the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?"" ""One of two things, either she's gone to bed Or gone out doors."" ""In which case both are lost.
Do you know what she's like?
Have you ever met her?
It's strange she doesn't want to speak to us."" ""Fred, see if you can hear what I hear.
Come."" ""A clock maybe."" ""Don't you hear something else?"" ""Not talking."" ""No."" ""Why, yes, I hear—what is it?"" ""What do you say it is?"" ""A baby's crying!
Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off."" ""Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that, Not if she's there."" ""What do you make of it?"" ""There's only one thing possible to make, That is, assuming—that she has gone out.
Of course she hasn't though."" They both sat down Helpless. ""There's nothing we can do till morning."" ""Fred, I shan't let you think of going out."" ""Hold on."" The double bell began to chirp.
They started up.
Fred took the telephone. ""Hello, Meserve.
You're there, then!—And your wife?
Good!
Why I asked—she didn't seem to answer.
He says she went to let him in the barn.— We're glad.
Oh, say no more about it, man.
Drop in and see us when you're passing."" ""Well.
She has him then, though what she wants him for I don't see."" ""Possibly not for herself.
Maybe she only wants him for the children."" ""The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.
What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.
What did he come in for?—To talk and visit?
Thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.
If he thinks he is going to make our house A halfway coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere——"" ""I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned."" ""You think you haven't been concerned yourself."" ""If you mean he was inconsiderate To rout us out to think for him at midnight And then take our advice no more than nothing, Why, I agree with you.
But let's forgive him.
We've had a share in one night of his life.
What'll you bet he ever calls again?"" IN THE HOME STRETCH She stood against the kitchen sink, and looked Over the sink out through a dusty window At weeds the water from the sink made tall.
She wore her cape; her hat was in her hand.
Behind her was confusion in the room, Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people In other chairs, and something, come to look, For every room a house has—parlor, bed-room, And dining-room—thrown pell-mell in the kitchen.
And now and then a smudged, infernal face Looked in a door behind her and addressed Her back.
She always answered without turning. ""Where will I put this walnut bureau, lady?"" ""Put it on top of something that's on top Of something else,"" she laughed. ""Oh, put it where You can to-night, and go.
It's almost dark; You must be getting started back to town."" Another blackened face thrust in and looked And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently, ""What are you seeing out the window, lady? "" ""Never was I beladied so before.
Would evidence of having been called lady More than so many times make me a lady In common law, I wonder."" ""But I ask, What are you seeing out the window, lady?"" ""What I'll be seeing more of in the years To come as here I stand and go the round Of many plates with towels many times."" ""And what is that?
You only put me off."" ""Rank weeds that love the water from the dish-pan More than some women like the dish-pan, Joe; A little stretch of mowing-field for you; Not much of that until I come to woods That end all.
And it's scarce enough to call A view."" ""And yet you think you like it, dear?"" ""That's what you're so concerned to know!
You hope I like it.
Bang goes something big away Off there upstairs.
The very tread of men As great as those is shattering to the frame Of such a little house.
Once left alone, You and I, dear, will go with softer steps Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands Will ever slam the doors."" ""I think you see More than you like to own to out that window."" ""No; for besides the things I tell you of, I only see the years.
They come and go In alternation with the weeds, the field, The wood."" ""What kind of years?"" ""Why, latter years— Different from early years."" ""I see them, too.
You didn't count them?"" ""No, the further off So ran together that I didn't try to.
It can scarce be that they would be in number We'd care to know, for we are not young now.
And bang goes something else away off there.
It sounds as if it were the men went down, And every crash meant one less to return To lighted city streets we, too, have known, But now are giving up for country darkness."" ""Come from that window where you see too much for me, And take a livelier view of things from here.
They're going.
Watch this husky swarming up Over the wheel into the sky-high seat, Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose At the flame burning downward as he sucks it."" ""See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof How dark it's getting.
Can you tell what time It is by that?
Or by the moon?
The new moon!
What shoulder did I see her over?
Neither.
A wire she is of silver, as new as we To everything.
Her light won't last us long.
It's something, though, to know we're going to have her Night after night and stronger every night To see us through our first two weeks.
But, Joe, The stove!
Before they go!
Knock on the window; Ask them to help you get it on its feet.
We stand here dreaming.
Hurry!
Call them back!"" ""They're not gone yet."" ""We've got to have the stove, Whatever else we want for.
And a light.
Have we a piece of candle if the lamp And oil are buried out of reach?"" Again The house was full of tramping, and the dark, Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.
A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall, To which they set it true by eye; and then Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands, So much too light and airy for their strength It almost seemed to come ballooning up, Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling. ""A fit!"" said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder. ""It's good luck when you move in to begin With good luck with your stovepipe.
Never mind, It's not so bad in the country, settled down, When people 're getting on in life.
You'll like it."" Joe said: ""You big boys ought to find a farm, And make good farmers, and leave other fellows The city work to do.
There's not enough For everybody as it is in there."" ""God!"" one said wildly, and, when no one spoke: ""Say that to Jimmy here.
He needs a farm."" But Jimmy only made his jaw recede Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say He saw himself a farmer.
Then there was a French boy Who said with seriousness that made them laugh, ""Ma friend, you ain't know what it is you're ask."" He doffed his cap and held it with both hands Across his chest to make as 'twere a bow: ""We're giving you our chances on de farm."" And then they all turned to with deafening boots And put each other bodily out of the house. ""Goodby to them!
We puzzle them.
They think— I don't know what they think we see in what They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems The back some farm presents us; and your woods To northward from your window at the sink, Waiting to steal a step on us whenever We drop our eyes or turn to other things, As in the game 'Ten-step' the children play."" ""Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city.
All they could say was 'God!' when you proposed Their coming out and making useful farmers."" ""Did they make something lonesome go through you?
It would take more than them to sicken you— Us of our bargain.
But they left us so As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with.
They almost shook me. "" ""It's all so much What we have always wanted, I confess It's seeming bad for a moment makes it seem Even worse still, and so on down, down, down.
It's nothing; it's their leaving us at dusk.
I never bore it well when people went.
The first night after guests have gone, the house Seems haunted or exposed.
I always take A personal interest in the locking up At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off."" He fetched a dingy lantern from behind A door. ""There's that we didn't lose!
And these!"" Some matches he unpocketed. ""For food— The meals we've had no one can take from us.
I wish that everything on earth were just As certain as the meals we've had.
I wish The meals we haven't had were, anyway.
What have you you know where to lay your hands on?"" ""The bread we bought in passing at the store.
There's butter somewhere, too."" ""Let's rend the bread.
I'll light the fire for company for you; You'll not have any other company Till Ed begins to get out on a Sunday To look us over and give us his idea Of what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up.
He'll know what he would do if he were we, And all at once.
He'll plan for us and plan To help us, but he'll take it out in planning.
Well, you can set the table with the loaf.
Let's see you find your loaf.
I'll light the fire.
I like chairs occupying other chairs Not offering a lady—"" ""There again, Joe!
You're tired. "" ""I'm drunk-nonsensical tired out; Don't mind a word I say.
It's a day's work To empty one house of all household goods And fill another with 'em fifteen miles away, Although you do no more than dump them down."" ""Dumped down in paradise we are and happy."" ""It's all so much what I have always wanted, I can't believe it's what you wanted, too."" ""Shouldn't you like to know?"" ""I'd like to know If it is what you wanted, then how much You wanted it for me."" ""A troubled conscience!
You don't want me to tell if I don't know."" ""I don't want to find out what can't be known.
But who first said the word to come?"" ""My dear, It's who first thought the thought.
You're searching, Joe, For things that don't exist; I mean beginnings.
Ends and beginnings—there are no such things.
There are only middles."" ""What is this?"" ""This life?
Our sitting here by lantern-light together Amid the wreckage of a former home?
You won't deny the lantern isn't new.
The stove is not, and you are not to me, Nor I to you."" ""Perhaps you never were?"" ""It would take me forever to recite All that's not new in where we find ourselves.
New is a word for fools in towns who think Style upon style in dress and thought at last Must get somewhere.
I've heard you say as much.
No, this is no beginning."" ""Then an end?"" ""End is a gloomy word."" ""Is it too late To drag you out for just a good-night call On the old peach trees on the knoll to grope By starlight in the grass for a last peach The neighbors may not have taken as their right When the house wasn't lived in?
I've been looking: I doubt if they have left us many grapes.
Before we set ourselves to right the house, The first thing in the morning, out we go To go the round of apple, cherry, peach, Pine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook.
All of a farm it is."" ""I know this much: I'm going to put you in your bed, if first I have to make you build it.
Come, the light."" When there was no more lantern in the kitchen, The fire got out through crannies in the stove And danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling, As much at home as if they'd always danced there."
THE ROAD NOT TAKEN,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveller, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference.
THE OVEN BIRD There is a singer everyone has heard, Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird, Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.
He says the early petal-fall is past When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers On sunny days a moment overcast; And comes that other fall we name the fall.
He says the highway dust is over all.
The bird would cease and be as other birds But that he knows in singing not to sing.
The question that he frames in all but words Is what to make of a diminished thing.
A VANTAGE POINT If tired of trees I seek again mankind, Well I know where to hie me—in the dawn, To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn.
There amid lolling juniper reclined, Myself unseen, I see in white defined Far off the homes of men, and farther still, The graves of men on an opposing hill, Living or dead, whichever are most to mind.
And if by noon I have too much of these, I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, I smell the earth, I smell the bruised plant, I look into the crater of the ant.
THE SOUND OF TREES I wonder about the trees.
Why do we wish to bear Forever the noise of these More than another noise So close to our dwelling place?
We suffer them by the day Till we lose all measure of pace, And fixity in our joys, And acquire a listening air.
They are that that talks of going But never gets away; And that talks no less for knowing, As it grows wiser and older, That now it means to stay.
My feet tug at the floor And my head sways to my shoulder Sometimes when I watch trees sway, From the window or the door.
I shall set forth for somewhere, I shall make the reckless choice Some day when they are in voice And tossing so as to scare The white clouds over them on.
I shall have less to say, But I shall be gone.
HYLA BROOK By June our brook's run out of song and speed.
Sought for much after that, it will be found Either to have gone groping underground (And taken with it all the Hyla breed That shouted in the mist a month ago, Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow)— Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed, Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent Even against the way its waters went.
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat— A brook to none but who remember long.
This as it will be seen is other far Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.
We love the things we love for what they are.
MY NOVEMBER GUEST My Sorrow, when she's here with me, Thinks these dark days of autumn rain Are beautiful as days can be; She loves the bare, the withered tree; She walks the sodden pasture lane.
Her pleasure will not let me stay.
She talks and I am fain to list: She's glad the birds are gone away, She's glad her simple worsted grey Is silver now with clinging mist.
The desolate, deserted trees, The faded earth, the heavy sky, The beauties she so truly sees, She thinks I have no eye for these, And vexes me for reason why.
Not yesterday I learned to know The love of bare November days Before the coming of the snow, But it were vain to tell her so, And they are better for her praise.
RANGE-FINDING The battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung And cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest Before it stained a single human breast.
The stricken flower bent double and so hung.
And still the bird revisited her young.
A butterfly its fall had dispossessed A moment sought in air his flower of rest, Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung.
On the bare upland pasture there had spread O'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread And straining cables wet with silver dew.
A sudden passing bullet shook it dry.
The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly, But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew.
OCTOBER O hushed October morning mild, Thy leaves have ripened to the fall; To-morrow's wind, if it be wild, Should waste them all.
The crows above the forest call; To-morrow they may form and go.
O hushed October morning mild, Begin the hours of this day slow, Make the day seem to us less brief.
Hearts not averse to being beguiled, Beguile us in the way you know; Release one leaf at break of day; At noon release another leaf; One from our trees, one far away; Retard the sun with gentle mist; Enchant the land with amethyst.
Slow, slow!
For the grapes' sake, if they were all, Whose leaves already are burnt with frost, Whose clustered fruit must else be lost— For the grapes' sake along the wall.
TO THE THAWING WIND Come with rain, O loud Southwester!
Bring the singer, bring the nester; Give the buried flower a dream; Make the settled snow-bank steam; Find the brown beneath the white; But whate'er you do to-night, Bathe my window, make it flow, Melt it as the ice will go; Melt the glass and leave the sticks Like a hermit's crucifix; Burst into my narrow stall; Swing the picture on the wall; Run the rattling pages o'er; Scatter poems on the floor; Turn the poet out of door."
A TIME TO TALK ,"When a friend calls to me from the road And slows his horse to a meaning walk I don't stand still and look around On all the hills I haven't hoed, And shout from where I am, What is it?
No, not as there is a time to talk.
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground, Blade-end up and five feet tall, And plod: I go up to the stone wall For a friendly visit.
THE CODE There were three in the meadow by the brook Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay, With an eye always lifted toward the west Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger Flickering across its bosom.
Suddenly One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground, Marched himself off the field and home.
One stayed.
The town-bred farmer failed to understand. ""What was there wrong?"" ""Something you just now said."" ""What did I say?"" ""About our taking pains. ""To cock the hay?—because it's going to shower?
I said that more than half an hour ago.
I said it to myself as much as you."" ""You didn't know.
But James is one big fool.
He thought you meant to find fault with his work.
That's what the average farmer would have meant.
James would take time, of course, to chew it over Before he acted: he's just got round to act."" ""He is a fool if that's the way he takes me."" ""Don't let it bother you.
You've found out something.
The hand that knows his business won't be told To do work better or faster—those two things.
I'm as particular as anyone: Most likely I'd have served you just the same.
But I know you don't understand our ways.
You were just talking what was in your mind, What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting.
Tell you a story of what happened once: I was up here in Salem at a man's Named Sanders with a gang of four or five Doing the haying.
No one liked the boss.
He was one of the kind sports call a spider, All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy From a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit.
But work! that man could work, especially If by so doing he could get more work, Out of his hired help.
I'm not denying He was hard on himself.
I couldn't find That he kept any hours—not for himself.
Daylight and lantern-light were one to him: I've heard him pounding in the barn all night.
But what he liked was someone to encourage.
Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing— Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.
I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks (We call that bulling).
I'd been watching him.
So when he paired off with me in the hayfield To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble.
I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O.
K.' Everything went well till we reached the barn With a big jag to empty in a bay.
You understand that meant the easy job For the man up on top of throwing down The hay and rolling it off wholesale, Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.
You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging Under those circumstances, would you now?
But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!
Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you said?' I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake, 'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.' He said it over, but he said it softer.
Never you say a thing like that to a man, Not if he values what he is.
God, I'd as soon Murdered him as left out his middle name.
I'd built the load and knew right where to find it.
Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for Like meditating, and then I just dug in And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots, I looked over the side once in the dust And caught sight of him treading-water-like, Keeping his head above. 'Damn ye,' I says, 'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat.
That was the last I saw or heard of him.
I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.
As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck, And sort of waiting to be asked about it, One of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?' 'I left him in the barn under the hay.
If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.' They realised from the way I swobbed my neck More than was needed something must be up.
They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.
They told me afterward.
First they forked hay, A lot of it, out into the barn floor.
Nothing!
They listened for him.
Not a rustle.
I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed.
They excavated more. 'Go keep his wife Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window, And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.
He looked so clean disgusted from behind There was no one that dared to stir him up, Or let him know that he was being looked at.
Apparently I hadn't buried him (I may have knocked him down); but my just trying To bury him had hurt his dignity.
He had gone to the house so's not to meet me.
He kept away from us all afternoon.
We tended to his hay.
We saw him out After a while picking peas in his garden: He couldn't keep away from doing something."" ""Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?"" ""No! and yet I don't know—it's hard to say.
I went about to kill him fair enough."" ""You took an awkward way.
Did he discharge you?"" ""Discharge me?
No!
He knew I did just right."" A HUNDRED COLLARS Lancaster bore him—such a little town, Such a great man.
It doesn't see him often Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead And sends the children down there with their mother To run wild in the summer—a little wild.
Sometimes he joins them for a day or two And sees old friends he somehow can't get near.
They meet him in the general store at night, Preoccupied with formidable mail, Rifling a printed letter as he talks.
They seem afraid.
He wouldn't have it so: Though a great scholar, he's a democrat, If not at heart, at least on principle.
Lately when coming up to Lancaster His train being late he missed another train And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction After eleven o'clock at night.
Too tired To think of sitting such an ordeal out, He turned to the hotel to find a bed. ""No room,"" the night clerk said. ""Unless——"" Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps And cars that shock and rattle—and one hotel. ""You say 'unless.'"" ""Unless you wouldn't mind Sharing a room with someone else."" ""Who is it?"" ""A man. ""So I should hope.
What kind of man?"" ""I know him: he's all right.
A man's a man.
Separate beds of course you understand."" The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on. ""Who's that man sleeping in the office chair?
Has he had the refusal of my chance?"" ""He was afraid of being robbed or murdered.
What do you say?"" ""I'll have to have a bed."" The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs And down a narrow passage full of doors, At the last one of which he knocked and entered, ""Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room."" ""Show him this way.
I'm not afraid of him, I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself."" The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. ""This will be yours.
Good-night,"" he said, and went. ""Lafe was the name, I think?"" ""Yes, Lay fayette.
You got it the first time.
And yours?"" ""Magoon.
Doctor Magoon."" ""A Doctor?"" ""Well, a teacher."" ""Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired?
Hold on, there's something I don't think of now That I had on my mind to ask the first Man that knew anything I happened in with.
I'll ask you later—don't let me forget it."" The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away.
A man?
A brute.
Naked above the waist, He sat there creased and shining in the light, Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt. ""I'm moving into a size-larger shirt.
I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it.
I just found what the matter was to-night: I've been a-choking like a nursery tree When it outgrows the wide band of its name tag.
I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. 'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, Not liking to own up I'd grown a size.
Number eighteen this is.
What size do you wear?"" The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. ""Oh—ah—fourteen—fourteen."" ""Fourteen!
You say so!
I can remember when I wore fourteen.
And come to think I must have back at home More than a hundred collars, size fourteen.
Too bad to waste them all.
You ought to have them.
They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you.
What makes you stand there on one leg like that?
You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you, You act as if you wished you hadn't come.
Sit down or lie down friend; you make me nervous."" The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, And propped himself at bay against a pillow. ""Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed.
You can't rest that way.
Let me pull your shoes off."" ""Don't touch me, please—I say, don't touch me, please.
I'll not be put to bed by you, my man."" ""Just as you say.
Have it your own way then. 'My man' is it?
You talk like a professor.
Speaking of who's afraid of who, however, I'm thinking I have more to lose than you If anything should happen to be wrong.
Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat!
Let's have a show down as an evidence Of good faith.
There is ninety dollars.
Come, if you're not afraid."" "" I 'm not afraid.
There's five: that's all I carry."" ""I can search you?
Where are you moving over to?
Stay still.
You'd better tuck your money under you And sleep on it the way I always do When I'm with people I don't trust at night."" ""Will you believe me if I put it there Right on the counterpane—that I do trust you?"" ""You'd say so, Mister Man.—I'm a collector.
My ninety isn't mine—you won't think that.
I pick it up a dollar at a time All round the country for the Weekly News , Published in Bow.
You know the Weekly News? "" ""Known it since I was young."" ""Then you know me.
Now we are getting on together—talking.
I'm sort of Something for it at the front.
My business is to find what people want: They pay for it, and so they ought to have it.
Fairbanks, he says to me—he's editor— Feel out the public sentiment—he says.
A good deal comes on me when all is said.
The only trouble is we disagree In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat— You know what that is, sort of double-dyed; The News has always been Republican.
Fairbanks, he says to me, 'Help us this year,' Meaning by us their ticket. 'No,' I says, 'I can't and won't.
You've been in long enough: It's time you turned around and boosted us.
You'll have to pay me more than ten a week If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft.
I doubt if I could do it anyway.'"" ""You seem to shape the paper's policy."" ""You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all.
I almost know their farms as well as they do."" ""You drive around?
It must be pleasant work."" ""It's business, but I can't say it's not fun.
What I like best's the lay of different farms, Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, Or over a hill or round a sudden corner.
I like to find folks getting out in spring, Raking the dooryard, working near the house.
Later they get out further in the fields.
Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; The family's all away in some back meadow.
There's a hay load a-coming—when it comes.
And later still they all get driven in: The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees To whips and poles.
There's nobody about.
The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking.
And I lie back and ride.
I take the reins Only when someone's coming, and the mare Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go.
I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one.
She's got so she turns in at every house As if she had some sort of curvature, No matter if I have no errand there.
She thinks I'm sociable.
I maybe am.
It's seldom I get down except for meals, though.
Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, All in a family row down to the youngest."" ""One would suppose they might not be as glad To see you as you are to see them."" ""Oh, Because I want their dollar.
I don't want Anything they've not got.
I never dun.
I'm there, and they can pay me if they like.
I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by.
Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink.
I drink out of the bottle—not your style.
Mayn't I offer you——?"" ""No, no, no, thank you. ""Just as you say.
Here's looking at you then.— And now I'm leaving you a little while.
You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps— Lie down—let yourself go and get some sleep.
But first—let's see—what was I going to ask you?
Those collars—who shall I address them to, Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?"" ""Really, friend, I can't let you.
You—may need them."" ""Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style."" ""But really—I have so many collars."" ""I don't know who I rather would have have them.
They're only turning yellow where they are.
But you're the doctor as the saying is.
I'll put the light out.
Don't you wait for me: I've just begun the night.
You get some sleep.
I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door When I come back so you'll know who it is.
There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people.
I don't want you should shoot me in the head.
What am I doing carrying off this bottle?
There now, you get some sleep."" He shut the door The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.
BLUEBERRIES ""You ought to have seen what I saw on my way To the village, through Mortenson's pasture to-day: Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb, Real sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum In the cavernous pail of the first one to come!
And all ripe together, not some of them green And some of them ripe!
You ought to have seen!"" ""I don't know what part of the pasture you mean."" ""You know where they cut off the woods—let me see— It was two years ago—or no!—can it be No longer than that?—and the following fall The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall."" ""Why, there hasn't been time for the bushes to grow.
That's always the way with the blueberries, though: There may not have been the ghost of a sign Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine, But get the pine out of the way, you may burn The pasture all over until not a fern Or grass-blade is left, not to mention a stick, And presto, they're up all around you as thick And hard to explain as a conjurer's trick."" ""It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit.
I taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot.
And after all really they're ebony skinned: The blue's but a mist from the breath of the wind, A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand, And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned."" ""Does Mortenson know what he has, do you think?"" ""He may and not care and so leave the chewink To gather them for him—you know what he is.
He won't make the fact that they're rightfully his An excuse for keeping us other folk out."" ""I wonder you didn't see Loren about."" ""The best of it was that I did.
Do you know, I was just getting through what the field had to show And over the wall and into the road, When who should come by, with a democrat-load Of all the young chattering Lorens alive, But Loren, the fatherly, out for a drive."" ""He saw you, then?
What did he do?
Did he frown?"" ""He just kept nodding his head up and down.
You know how politely he always goes by.
But he thought a big thought—I could tell by his eye— Which being expressed, might be this in effect: 'I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect, To ripen too long.
I am greatly to blame.'"" ""He's a thriftier person than some I could name."" ""He seems to be thrifty; and hasn't he need, With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed?
He has brought them all up on wild berries, they say, Like birds.
They store a great many away.
They eat them the year round, and those they don't eat They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet."" ""Who cares what they say?
It's a nice way to live, Just taking what Nature is willing to give, Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow."" ""I wish you had seen his perpetual bow— And the air of the youngsters!
Not one of them turned, And they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned."" ""I wish I knew half what the flock of them know Of where all the berries and other things grow, Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top Of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop.
I met them one day and each had a flower Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower; Some strange kind—they told me it hadn't a name."" ""I've told you how once, not long after we came, I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth By going to him of all people on earth To ask if he knew any fruit to be had For the picking.
The rascal, he said he'd be glad To tell if he knew.
But the year had been bad.
There had been some berries—but those were all gone.
He didn't say where they had been.
He went on: 'I'm sure—I'm sure'—as polite as could be.
He spoke to his wife in the door, 'Let me see, Marne, we don't know any good berrying place?' It was all he could do to keep a straight face."" ""If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him, He'll find he's mistaken.
See here, for a whim, We'll pick in the Mortensons' pasture this year.
We'll go in the morning, that is, if it's clear, And the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet.
It's so long since I picked I almost forget How we used to pick berries: we took one look round, Then sank out of sight like trolls underground, And saw nothing more of each other, or heard, Unless when you said I was keeping a bird Away from its nest, and I said it was you. 'Well, one of us is.' For complaining it flew Around and around us.
And then for a while We picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile, And I thought I had lost you.
I lifted a shout Too loud for the distance you were, it turned out, For when you made answer, your voice was as low As talking—you stood up beside me, you know."" ""We shan't have the place to ourselves to enjoy— Not likely, when all the young Lorens deploy.
They'll be there to-morrow, or even to-night.
They won't be too friendly—they may be polite— To people they look on as having no right To pick where they're picking.
But we won't complain.
You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain, The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves, Like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves."" BROWN'S DESCENT OR, THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE Brown lived at such a lofty farm That everyone for miles could see His lantern when he did his chores In winter after half-past three.
And many must have seen him make His wild descent from there one night, 'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything, Describing rings of lantern light.
Between the house and barn the gale Got him by something he had on And blew him out on the icy crust That cased the world, and he was gone!
Walls were all buried, trees were few: He saw no stay unless he stove A hole in somewhere with his heel.
But though repeatedly he strove And stamped and said things to himself, And sometimes something seemed to yield, He gained no foothold, but pursued His journey down from field to field.
Sometimes he came with arms outspread Like wings, revolving in the scene Upon his longer axis, and With no small dignity of mien.
Faster or slower as he chanced, Sitting or standing as he chose, According as he feared to risk His neck, or thought to spare his clothes, He never let the lantern drop.
And some exclaimed who saw afar The figures he described with it, ""I wonder what those signals are Brown makes at such an hour of night!
He's celebrating something strange.
I wonder if he's sold his farm, Or been made Master of the Grange."" He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked; He fell and made the lantern rattle (But saved the light from going out).
So half-way down he fought the battle Incredulous of his own bad luck.
And then becoming reconciled To everything, he gave it up And came down like a coasting child. ""Well—I—be——"" that was all he said, As standing in the river road, He looked back up the slippery slope (Two miles it was) to his abode.
Sometimes as an authority On motor-cars, I'm asked if I Should say our stock was petered out, And this is my sincere reply: Yankees are what they always were.
Don't think Brown ever gave up hope Of getting home again because He couldn't climb that slippery slope; Or even thought of standing there Until the January thaw Should take the polish off the crust.
He bowed with grace to natural law, And then went round it on his feet, After the manner of our stock; Not much concerned for those to whom, At that particular time o'clock, It must have looked as if the course He steered was really straight away From that which he was headed for— Not much concerned for them, I say.
But now he snapped his eyes three times; Then shook his lantern, saying, ""Ile's 'Bout out!"" and took the long way home By road, a matter of several miles."
Benediction,"When by the changeless Power of a Supreme Decree The poet issues forth upon this sorry sphere, His mother, horrified, and full of blasphemy, Uplifts her voice to God, who takes compassion on her. ""Ah, why did I not bear a serpent's nest entire, Instead of bringing forth this hideous Child of Doom!
Oh cursèd be that transient night of vain desire When I conceived my expiation in my womb!"" ""Yet since among all women thou hast chosen me To be the degradation of my jaded mate, And since I cannot like a love-leaf wantonly Consign this stunted monster to the glowing grate,"" ""I'll cause thine overwhelming hatred to rebound Upon the cursèd tool of thy most wicked spite.
Forsooth, the branches of this wretched tree I'll wound And rob its pestilential blossoms of their might!"" So thus, she giveth vent unto her foaming ire, And knowing not the changeless statutes of all times, Herself, amid the flames of hell, prepares the pyre; The consecrated penance of maternal crimes.
Yet 'neath th' invisible shelter of an Angel's wing This sunlight-loving infant disinherited, Exhales from all he eats and drinks, and everything The ever sweet ambrosia and the nectar red.
He trifles with the winds and with the clouds that glide, About the way unto the Cross, he loves to sing, The spirit on his pilgrimage; that faithful guide, Oft weeps to see him joyful like a bird of Spring.
All those that he would cherish shrink from him with fear, And some that waxen bold by his tranquility, Endeavour hard some grievance from his heart to tear, And make on him the trial of their ferocity.
Within the bread and wine outspread for his repast To mingle dust and dirty spittle they essay, And everything he touches, forth they slyly cast, Or scourge themselves, if e'er their feet betrod his way.
His wife goes round proclaiming in the crowded quads— ""Since he can find my body beauteous to behold, Why not perform the office of those ancient gods And like unto them, redeck myself with shining gold?"" ""I'll bathe myself with incense, spikenard and myrrh, With genuflexions, delicate viandes and wine, To see, in jest, if from a heart, that loves me dear, I cannot filch away the hommages divine."" ""And when of these impious jokes at length I tire, My frail but mighty hands, around his breast entwined, With nails, like harpies' nails, shall cunningly conspire The hidden path unto his feeble heart to find."" ""And like a youngling bird that trembles in its nest, I'll pluck his heart right out; within its own blood drowned, And finally to satiate my favourite beast, I'll throw it with intense disdain upon the ground!"" Towards the Heavens where he sees the sacred grail The poet calmly stretches forth his pious arms, Whereon the lightenings from his lucid spirit veil The sight of the infuriated mob that swarms. ""Oh blest be thou, Almighty who bestowest pain, Like some divine redress for our infirmities, And like the most refreshing and the purest rain, To sanctify the strong, for saintly ecstasies."" ""I know that for the poet thou wilt grant a chair, Among the Sainted Legion and the Blissful ones, That of the endless feast thou wilt accord his share To him, of Virtues, Dominations and of Thrones."" ""I know, that Sorrow is that nobleness alone, Which never may corrupted be by hell nor curse, I know, in order to enwreathe my mystic crown I must inspire the ages and the universe."" ""And yet the buried jewels of Palmyra old, The undiscovered metals and the pearly sea Of gems, that unto me you show could never hold Beside this diadem of blinding brilliancy."" ""For it shall be engendered from the purest fire Of rays primeval, from the holy hearth amassed, Of which the eyes of Mortals, in their sheen entire, Are but the tarnished mirrors, sad and overcast!"""
Echoes,"In Nature's temple, living columns rise, Which oftentimes give tongue to words subdued, And Man traverses this symbolic wood, Which looks at him with half familiar eyes, Like lingering echoes, which afar confound Themselves in deep and sombre unity, As vast as Night, and like transplendency, The scents and colours to each other respond.
And scents there are, like infant's flesh as chaste, As sweet as oboes, and as meadows fair, And others, proud, corrupted, rich and vast, Which have the expansion of infinity, Like amber, musk and frankincense and myrrh, That sing the soul's and senses' ecstasy."
The Sick Muse,"Alas—my poor Muse—what aileth thee now?
Thine eyes are bedimmed with the visions of Night, And silent and cold—I perceive on thy brow In their turns—Despair and Madness alight.
A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red, Has it poured o'er thee Horror and Love from its urn?
Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing hath led Thee to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne?
I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull, That thy breast with strong thoughts could for ever be full, And that rhymthmic'ly flowing—thy Christian blood Could resemble the olden-time metrical-flood, Where each in his turn reigned the father of Rhymes Phoebus—and Pan, lord of Harvest-times."
The Venal Muse,"Oh Muse of my heart—so fond of palaces old, Wilt have—when New Year speeds its wintry blast, Amid those tedious nights, with snow o'ercast, A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold?
Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep?
And—void thy purse and void thy palace—reap A golden hoard within some azure hive?
Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night, Suspend the censer like an acolyte, Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease, Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene Essay to lull the vulgar rabble's spleen; Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees."
The Evil Monk,"The cloisters old, expounded on their walls With paintings, the Beatic Verity, The which—adorning their religious halls, Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity.
In days when Christian seeds bloomed o'er the land, Full many a noble monk unknown to-day, Upon the field of tombs would take his stand, Exalting Death in rude and simple way.
My soul is a tomb where—bad monk that I be— I dwell and search its depths from all eternity, And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot.
Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright From the living spectacle of my bitter lot, To mold my handywork and mine eyes' Delight?"
The Enemy,"My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm, Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun; The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one.
Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached, And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume, In collecting the turf, inundated and breached, Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb.
And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved, Will they find in this earth—like a shore that is laved— The mystical fuel which vigour imparts?
Oh misery!—Time devours our lives, And the enemy black, which consumeth our hearts On the blood of our bodies, increases and thrives!"
Ill Luck,"This heavy burden to uplift, O Sysiphus, thy pluck is required!
And even though the heart aspired, Art is long and Time is swift.
Afar from sepulchres renowned, To a graveyard, quite apart, Like a broken drum, my heart, Beats the funeral marches' sound.
Many a buried jewel sleeps In the long-forgotten deeps, Far from mattock and from sound; Many a flower wafts aloft Its perfumes, like a secret soft, Within the solitudes, profound."
Interior Life,"A long while I dwelt beneath vast porticoes, While the ocean-suns bathed with a thousand fires, And which with their great and majestic spires, At eventide looked like basaltic grottoes.
The billows, in rolling depictured the skies, And mingled, in solemn and mystical strain, The all-mighteous chords of their luscious refrain With the sun-set's colours reflexed in mine eyes.
It is there that I lived in exalted calm, In the midst of the azure, the splendour, the waves, While pregnant with perfumes, naked slaves Refreshed my forehead with branches of palm, Whose gentle and only care was to know The secret that caused me to languish so."
Man and the Sea,"Free man! the sea is to thee ever dear!
The sea is thy mirror, thou regardest thy soul In its mighteous waves that unendingly roll, And thy spirit is yet not a chasm less drear.
Thou delight'st to plunge deep in thine image down; Thou tak'st it with eyes and with arms in embrace, And at times thine own inward voice would'st efface With the sound of its savage ungovernable moan.
You are both of you, sombre, secretive and deep: Oh mortal, thy depths are foraye unexplored, Oh sea—no one knoweth thy dazzling hoard, You both are so jealous your secrets to keep!
And endless ages have wandered by, Yet still without pity or mercy you fight, So mighty in plunder and death your delight: Oh wrestlers! so constant in enmity!"
Beauty,"I am lovely, O mortals, like a dream of stone, And my bosom, where each one gets bruised in turn, To inspire the love of a poet is prone, Like matter eternally silent and stern.
As an unfathomed sphinx, enthroned by the Nile, My heart a swan's whiteness with granite combines, And I hate every movement, displacing the lines, And never I weep and never I smile.
The poets in front of mine attitudes fine (Which the proudest of monuments seem to implant), To studies profound all their moments assign, For I have all these docile swains to enchant— Two mirrors, which Beauty in all things ignite: Mine eyes, my large eyes, of eternal Light!"
The Ideal,"It could ne'er be those beauties of ivory vignettes; The varied display of a worthless age, Nor puppet-like figures with castonets, That ever an heart like mine could engage.
I leave to Gavarni, that poet of chlorosis, His hospital-beauties in troups that whirl, For I cannot discover amid his pale roses A flower to resemble my scarlet ideal.
Since, what for this fathomless heart I require Is—Lady Macbeth you! in crime so dire; —An Æschylus dream transposed from the South— Or thee, oh great ""Night"" of Michael-Angelo born, Who so calmly thy limbs in strange posture hath drawn, Whose allurements are framed for a Titan's mouth."
The Giantess,"I should have loved—erewhile when Heaven conceived Each day, some child abnormal and obscene, Beside a maiden giantess to have lived, Like a luxurious cat at the feet of a queen; To see her body flowering with her soul, And grow, unchained, in awe-inspiring art, Within the mists across her eyes that stole To divine the fires entombed within her heart.
And oft to scramble o'er her mighty limbs, And climb the slopes of her enormous knees, Or in summer when the scorching sunlight streams Across the country, to recline at ease, And slumber in the shadow of her breast Like an hamlet 'neath the mountain-crest."
Hymn to Beauty,"O Beauty! dost thou generate from Heaven or from Hell?
Within thy glance, so diabolic and divine, Confusedly both wickedness and goodness dwell, And hence one might compare thee unto sparkling wine.
Thy look containeth both the dawn and sunset stars, Thy perfumes, as upon a sultry night exhale, Thy kiss a philter, and thy mouth a Grecian vase, That renders heroes cowardly and infants hale.
Yea, art thou from the planets, or the fiery womb?
The demon follows in thy train, with magic fraught, Thou scatter'st seeds haphazardly of joy and doom, Thou govern'st everything, but answer'st unto nought.
O Loveliness! thou spurnest corpses with delight, Among thy jewels, Horror hath such charms for thee, And Murder 'mid thy mostly cherished trinklets bright, Upon thy massive bosom dances amorously.
The blinded, fluttering moth towards the candle flies, Then frizzles, falls, and falters—""Blessings unto thee""— The panting swain that o'er his beauteous mistress sighs, Seems like the Sick, that stroke their gravestones lovingly.
What matter, if thou comest from the Heavens or Hell, O Beauty, frightful ghoul, ingenuous and obscure!
So long thine eyes, thy smile, to me the way can tell Towards that Infinite I love, but never saw.
From God or Satan?
Angel, Mermaid, Proserpine?
What matter if thou makest—blithe, voluptuous sprite— With rhythms, perfumes, visions—O mine only queen!— The universe less hideous and the hours less trite."
Exotic Perfume,"When, with closed eyes, on a hot afternoon, The scent of thine ardent breast I inhale, Celestial vistas my spirit assail; Caressed by the flames of an endless sun.
A langorous island, where Nature abounds With exotic trees and luscious fruit; And with men whose bodies are slim and astute, And with women whose frankness delights and astounds.
By thy perfume enticed to this region remote, A port I see, laden with mast and with boat, Still wearied and torn by the distant brine; While the tamarisk-odours that dreamily throng The air, round my slumberous senses intwine, And mix, in my soul, with the mariners' song."
La Chevelure,"O fleece, that foams down unto the shoulders bare!
O curls, O scents which lovely languidness exhale!
Delight! to fill this alcove's sombre atmosphere With memories, sleeping deep within this tress of hair, I'll wave it in the evening breezes like a veil!
The shores of Africa, and Asia's burning skies, A world forgotten, distant, nearly dead and spent, Within thy depths, O aromatic forest! lies.
And like to spirits floating unto melodies, Mine own, Belovèd! glides within thy sacred scent.
There I will hasten, where the trees and humankind With languor lull beside the hot and silent sea; Strong tresses bear me, be to me the waves and wind!
Within thy fragrance lies a dazzling dream confined Of sails and masts and flames—O lake of ebony!
A loudly echoing harbour, where my soul may hold To quaff, the silver cup of colours, scents and sounds, Wherein the vessels glide upon a sea of gold, And stretch their mighty arms, the glory to enfold Of virgin skies, where never-ending heat abounds.
I'll plunge my brow, enamoured with voluptuousness Within this darkling ocean of infinitude, Until my subtle spirit, which thy waves caress, Shall find you once again, O fertile weariness; Unending lullabye of perfumed lassitude!
Ye tresses blue—recess of strange and sombre shades, Ye make the azure of the starry Realm immense; Upon the downy beeches, by your curls' cascades, Among your mingling fragrances, my spirit wades To cull the musk and cocoa-nut and lotus scents.
Long—foraye—my hand, within thy heavy mane, Shall scatter rubies, pearls, sapphires eternally, And thus my soul's desire for thee shall never wane; For art not thou the oasis where I dream and drain With draughts profound, the golden wine of memory?"
Sonnet XXVIII,"With pearly robes that wave within the wind, Even when she walks, she seems to dance, Like swaying serpents round those wands entwined Which fakirs ware in rhythmic elegance.
So like the desert's Blue, and the sands remote, Both, deaf to mortal suffering and to strife, Or like the sea-weeds 'neath the waves that float, Indifferently she moulds her budding life.
Her polished eyes are made of minerals bright, And in her mien, symbolical and cold, Wherein an angel mingles with a sphinx of old, Where all is gold, and steel, and gems, and light, There shines, just like a useless star eternally, The sterile woman's frigid majesty."
Posthumous Remorse,"Ah, when thou shalt slumber, my darkling love, Beneath a black marble-made statuette, And when thou'lt have nought for thy house or alcove, But a cavernous den and a damp oubliette.
When the tomb-stone, oppressing thy timorous breast, And thy hips drooping sweetly with listless decay, The pulse and desires of mine heart shall arrest, And thy feet from pursuing their adventurous way, Then the grave, that dark friend of my limitless dreams (For the grave ever readeth the poet aright), Amid those long nights, which no slumber redeems 'Twill query—""What use to thee, incomplete spright That thou ne'er hast unfathomed the tears of the dead""?— Then the worms will gnaw deep at thy body, like Dread."
The Balcony,"Oh, Mother of Memories!
Mistress of Mistresses!
Oh, thou all my pleasures, oh, thou all my prayers!
Can'st thou remember those luscious caresses, The charm of the hearth and the sweet evening airs?
Oh, Mother, of Memories, Mistress of Mistresses!
Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal, And those roseate nights with their vaporous wings, How calm was thy breast and how good was thy soul, 'Twas then we uttered imperishable things, Those evenings illumed by the glow of the coal.
How lovely the suns on those hot, autumn nights!
How vast were the heavens! and the heart how hale!
As I leaned towards you—oh, my Queen of Delights, The scent of thy blood I seemed to inhale.
How lovely the sun on those hot, autumn nights!
The shadows of night-time grew dense like a pall, And deep through the darkness thine eyes I divined, And I drank of thy breath—oh sweetness, oh gall, And thy feet in my brotherly hands reclined, The shadows of Night-time grew dense like a pall.
I know how to call forth those moments so dear, And to live my Past—laid on thy knees—once more, For where should I seek for thy beauties but here In thy langorous heart and thy body so pure?
I know how to call forth those moments so dear.
Those perfumes, those infinite kisses and sighs, Are they born in some gulf to our plummets denied?
Like rejuvenate suns that mount up to the skies, That first have been cleansed in the depths of the tide; Oh, perfumes! oh, infinite kisses and sighs!"
The Possessed One,"The sun is enveloped in crape! like it, O Moon of my Life! wrap thyself up in shade; At will, smoke or slumber, be silent, be staid, And dive deep down in Dispassion's dark pit.
I cherish thee thus!
But if 'tis thy mood, Like a star that from out its penumbra appears, To float in the regions where madness careers, Fair dagger! burst forth from thy sheath! 'tis good.
Yea, light up thine eyes at the Fire of Renown!
Or kindle desire by the looks of some clown!
Thine All is my joy, whether dull or aflame!
Just be what thou wilt, black night, dawn divine, There is not a nerve in my trembling frame But cries, ""I adore thee, Beelzebub mine!"""
Semper Eadem,"""From whence it comes, you ask, this gloom acute, Like waves that o'er the rocky headland fall?"" —When once our hearts have gathered in their fruit, To live is a curse! a secret known to all, A grief, quite simple, nought mysterious, And like your joy—for all, both loud and shrill, Nay cease to clamour, be not e'er so curious!
And yet although your voice is sweet, be still!
Be still, O soul, with rapture ever rife!
O mouth, with the childish smile!
Far more than Life, The subtle bonds of Death around us twine.
Let—let my heart, the wine of falsehood drink, And dream-like, deep within your fair eyes sink, And in the shade of thy lashes long recline!"
All Entire,"The Demon, in my lofty vault, This morning came to visit me, And striving me to find at fault, He said, ""Fain would I know of thee; ""Among the many beauteous things, —All which her subtle grace proclaim— Among the dark and rosy things, Which go to make her charming frame, ""Which is the sweetest unto thee""?
My soul! to Him thou didst retort— ""Since all with her is destiny, Of preference there can be nought.
When all transports me with delight, If aught deludes I can not know, She either lulls one like the Night, Or dazzles like the Morning-glow.
That harmony is too divine, Which governs all her body fair, For powerless mortals to define In notes the many concords there.
O mystic metamorphosis Of all my senses blent in one!
Her voice a beauteous perfume is, Her breath makes music, chaste and wan."
Sonnet XLIII,"What sayest thou, to-night, poor soul so drear, What sayest—heart erewhile engulfed in gloom, To the very lovely, very chaste, and very dear, Whose god-like look hath made thee to re-bloom?
To her, with pride we chant an echoing Hymn, For nought can touch the sweetness of her sway; Her flesh ethereal as the seraphim, Her eyes with robe of light our souls array.
And be it in the night, or solitude, Among the streets or 'mid the multitude, Her shadow, torch-like, dances in the air, And murmurs, ""I, the Beautiful proclaim— That for my sake, alone ye love the Fair; I am the Guardian Angel, Muse and Dame!"""
The Living Torch,"They stand before me now, those eyes that shine, No doubt inspired by an Angel wise; They stand, those God-like brothers that are mine, And pour their diamond fires in mine eyes.
From all transgressions, from all snares, they save, Towards the Path of Joy they guide my ways; They are my servants, and I am their slave; And all my soul, this living torch obeys.
Ye charming Eyes—ye have those mystic beams, Of candles, burning in full day; the sun Awakes, yet kills not their fantastic gleams: Ye sing the Awak'ning, they the dark oblivion; The Awak'ning of my spirit ye proclaim, O stars—no sun can ever kill your flame!"
The Spiritual Dawn,"When the morning white and rosy breaks, With the gnawing Ideal, upon the debauchee, By the power of a strange decree, Within the sotted beast an Angel wakes.
The mental Heaven's inaccessible blue, For wearied mortals that still dream and mourn, Expands and sinks; towards the chasm drawn.
Thus, cherished goddess, Being pure and true— Upon the rests of foolish orgy-nights Thine image, more sublime, more pink, more clear, Before my staring eyes is ever there.
The sun has darkened all the candle lights; And thus thy spectre like the immortal sun, Is ever victorious—thou resplendent one!"
Evening Harmony,"The hour approacheth, when, as their stems incline, The flowers evaporate like an incense urn, And sounds and scents in the vesper breezes turn; A melancholy waltz—and a drowsiness divine.
The flowers evaporate like an incense urn, The viol vibrates like the wailing of souls that repine.
A melancholy waltz—and a drowsiness divine, The skies like a mosque are beautiful and stern.
The viol vibrates like the wailing of souls that repine; Sweet souls that shrink from chaos vast and etern, The skies like a mosque are beautiful and stern, The sunset drowns within its blood-red brine.
Sweet souls that shrink from chaos vast and etern, Essay the wreaths of their faded Past to entwine, The sunset drowns within its blood-red brine, Thy thought within me glows like an incense urn."
Overcast Sky,"Meseemeth thy glance, soft enshrouded with dew, Thy mysterious eyes (are they grey, green or blue?), Alternately cruel, and tender, and shy, Reflect both the languor and calm of the sky.
Thou recallest those white days—with shadows caressed, Engendering tears from th' enraptured breast, When racked by an anguish unfathomed that weeps, The nerves, too awake, jibe the spirit that sleeps.
At times—thou art like those horizons divine, Where the suns of the nebulous seasons decline; How resplendent art thou—O pasturage vast, Illumed by the beams of a sky overcast!
O! dangerous dame—oh seductive clime!
As well, will I love both thy snow and thy rime, And shall I know how from the frosts to entice Delights that are keener than iron and ice?"
Invitation to a Journey,"My sister, my dear Consider how fair, Together to live it would be!
Down yonder to fly To love, till we die, In the land which resembles thee.
Those suns that rise 'Neath erratic skies, —No charm could be like unto theirs— So strange and divine, Like those eyes of thine Which glow in the midst of their tears.
There, all is order and loveliness, Luxury, calm and voluptuousness.
The tables and chairs, Polished bright by the years, Would decorate sweetly our rooms, And the rarest of flowers Would twine round our bowers And mingle their amber perfumes: The ceilings arrayed, And the mirrors inlaid, This Eastern splendour among, Would furtively steal O'er our souls, and appeal With its tranquillous native tongue.
There, all is order and loveliness, Luxury, calm and voluptuousness.
In the harbours, peep, At the vessels asleep (Their humour is always to roam), Yet it is but to grant Thy smallest want From the ends of the earth that they come, The sunsets beam Upon meadow and stream, And upon the city entire 'Neath a violet crest, The world sinks to rest, Illumed by a golden fire.
There, all is order and loveliness, Luxury, calm and voluptuousness."
"""Causerie""","You are a roseate autumn-sky, that glows!
Yet sadness rises in me like the flood, And leaves in ebbing on my lips morose, The poignant memory of its bitter mind.
In vain your hands my swooning breast embrace, Oh, friend! alone remains the plundered spot, Where woman's biting grip has left its trace: My heart, the beasts devoured--seek it not!
My heart is a palace pillaged by the herd; They kill and take each other by the throat!
A perfume glides around your bosom bared-- O loveliness, thou scourge of souls--devote Thine eyes of fire--luminous-like feasts, To burn these rags--rejected by the beasts!"
Autumn Song,"I Shortly we will plunge within the frigid gloom, Farewell swift summer brightness; all too short-- I hear already sounding with a death-like boom The wood that falls upon the pavement of the court.
The whole of winter enters in my Being--pain, Hate, honor, labour hard and forced--and dread, And like the northern sun upon its polar plane My heart will soon be but a stone, iced and red.
I listen trembling unto every log that falls, The scaffold, which they build, has not a duller sound, My spirits waver, like the trembling tower walls that shake--with every echoing blow the builders pound.
Meeseemeth--as to these monotonous blows I sway, They nail for one a coffin lid, or sound a knell-- For whom?
Autumn now--and summer yesterday!
This strange mysterious noise betokens a farewell.
II I love within your oblong eyes the verdant rays, My sweet! but bitter everything to-day meseems: And nought--your love, the boudoir, nor the flickering blaze, Can replace the sun that o'er the screen streams.
And yet bemother and caress me, tender heart!
Even me the thankless and the worthless one; Beloved or sister--unto me the sweets impart Of a glorious autumn or a sinking sun.
Ephemeral task! the beckoning the beckoning empty tomb is set!
Oh grant me--as upon your knees my head I lay, (Because the white and torrid summer I regret), To taste the parted season's mild and amber ray."
Sisina,"Imagine Diana in gorgeous array, How into the forests and thickets she flies, With her hair in the breezes, and flushed for the fray, How the very best riders she proudly defies.
Have you seen Théroigne, of the blood-thirsty heart, As an unshod herd to attack he bestirs, With cheeks all inflamed, playing up to his part, As he goes, sword in hand, up the royal stairs?
And so is Sisina—yet this warrior sweet, Has a soul with compassion and kindness replete, Inspired by drums and by powder, her sway Knows how to concede to the supplicants' prayers, And her bosom, laid waste by the flames, has alway, For those that are worthy, a fountain of tears."
To a Creolean Lady,"In a country perfumed with the sun's embrace, I knew 'neath a dais of purpled palms, And branches where idleness weeps o'er one's face, A Creolean lady of unknown charms.
Her tint, pale and warm—this bewitching bride, Displays a nobly nurtured mien, Courageous and grand like a huntsman, her stride; A tranquil smile and eyes serene.
If, madam, you'd go to the true land of gain, By the banks of the verdant Loire or the Seine, How worthy to garnish some pile of renown.
You'd awake in the calm of some shadowy nest, A thousand songs in the poet's breast, That your eyes would inspire far more than your brown."
Moesta et Errabunda,"Oh, Agatha, tell! does thy heart not at times fly away?
Far from the city impure and the lowering sea, To another ocean that blinds with its dazzling array, So blue and so clear and profound, like virginity?
Oh, Agatha, tell! does thy heart not at times fly away?
The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles!
What demon hath gifted the sea with a voice from on high, To sing us (attuned to an Æolus-organ that rolls Forth a grumbling burden) a lenitive lullabye?
The sea, the vast ocean our travail and trouble consoles!
Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing-ships, help me depart!
Far, far, here the dust is quite wet with our showering tears, Oh, say! it is true that Agatha's desolate heart, Proclaimeth, ""Away from remorse, and from crimes, and from cares,"" Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing ships, help me depart!
How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields!
Wherein there is nothing but sunshine and love and glee; Where all that one loves is so worthy, and lovingly yields, And our hearts float about in the purest of ecstasy, How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields!
But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves, The strolls, and the songs, and the kisses, and bunches of flowers, The viols vibrating beyond, in the mountainous groves, With the chalice of wine and the evening, entwined, in the bowers, But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves.
That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight, Than China or India, is it still further away?
Or, could one with pityful prayers bring it back to our sight?
Or yet with a silvery voice o'er the ages convey That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight!"
The Ghost,"Just like an angel with evil eye, I shall return to thee silently, Upon thy bower I'll alight, With falling shadows of the night.
With thee, my brownie, I'll commune, And give thee kisses cold as the moon, And with a serpent's moist embrace, I'll crawl around thy resting-place.
And when the livid morning falls, Thou'lt find alone the empty walls, And till the evening, cold 'twill be.
As others with their tenderness, Upon thy life and youthfulness, I'll reign alone with dread o'er thee."
Autumn Song,"They ask me—thy crystalline eyes, so acute, ""Odd lover—why am I to thee so dear?"" —Be sweet and keep silent, my heart, which is sear, For all save the rude and untutored brute, Is loth its infernal depths to reveal, And its dissolute motto engraven with fire, Oh charmer! whose arms endless slumber inspire!
I abominate passion and wit makes me ill.
So let us love gently.
Within his retreat, Foreboding, Love seeks for his arrows a prey, I know all the arms of his battle array.
Delirium and loathing—O pale Marguerite!
Like me, art thou not an autumnal ray, Alas my so white, my so cold Marguerite!"
Sadness of the Moon-Goddess,"To-night the Moon dreams with increased weariness, Like a beauty stretched forth on a downy heap Of rugs, while her languorous fingers caress The contour of her breasts, before falling to sleep.
On the satin back of the avalanche soft, She falls into lingering swoons, as she dies, While she lifteth her eyes to white visions aloft, Which like efflorescence float up to the skies.
When at times, in her languor, down on to this sphere, She slyly lets trickle a furtive tear, A poet, desiring slumber to shun, Takes up this pale tear in the palm of his hand (The colours of which like an opal blend), And buries it far from the eyes of the sun."
Cats,"All ardent lovers and all sages prize, —As ripening years incline upon their brows— The mild and mighty cats—pride of the house— That like unto them are indolent, stern and wise.
The friends of Learning and of Ecstasy, They search for silence and the horrors of gloom; The devil had used them for his steeds of Doom, Could he alone have bent their pride to slavery.
When musing, they display those outlines chaste, Of the great sphinxes—stretched o'er the sandy waste, That seem to slumber deep in a dream without end: From out their loins a fountainous furnace flies, And grains of sparkling gold, as fine as sand, Bestar the mystic pupils of their eyes."
Owls,"Beneath the shades of sombre yews, The silent owls sit ranged in rows, Like ancient idols, strangely pose, And darting fiery eyes, they muse.
Immovable, they sit and gaze, Until the melancholy hour, At which the darknesses devour The faded sunset's slanting rays.
Their attitude, instructs the wise, That he—within this world—who flies From tumult and from merriment; The man allured by a passing face, For ever bears the chastisement Of having wished to change his place."
Music,"Oft Music possesses me like the seas!
To my planet pale, 'Neath a ceiling of mist, in the lofty breeze, I set my sail.
With inflated lungs and expanded chest, Like to a sail, On the backs of the heaped-up billows I rest— Which the shadows veil— I feel all the anguish within me arise Of a ship in distress; The tempest, the rain, 'neath the lowering skies, My body caress; At times, the calm pool or the mirror clear Of my despair!"
The Joyous Defunct,"Where snails abound—in a juicy soil, I will dig for myself a fathomless grave, Where at leisure mine ancient bones I can coil, And sleep—quite forgotten—like a shark 'neath the wave.
I hate every tomb—I abominate wills, And rather than tears from the world to implore, I would ask of the crows with their vampire bills To devour every bit of my carcass impure.
Oh worms, without eyes, without ears, black friends!
To you a defunct-one, rejoicing, descends, Enlivened Philosophers—offspring of Dung!
Without any qualms, o'er my wreckage spread, And tell if some torment there still can be wrung For this soul-less old frame that is dead 'midst the dead!"
The Broken Bell,"How sweet and bitter, on a winter night, Beside the palpitating fire to list, As, slowly, distant memories alight, To sounds of chimes that sing across the mist.
Oh, happy is that bell with hearty throat, Which neither age nor time can e'er defeat, Which faithfully uplifts its pious note, Like an agèd soldier on his beat.
For me, my soul is cracked, and 'mid her cares, Would often fill with her songs the midnight airs And oft it chances that her feeble moan Is like the wounded warrior's fainting groan, Who by a lake of blood, 'neath bodies slain, In anguish falls, and never moves again."
Spleen,"The rainy moon of all the world is weary, And from its urn a gloomy cold pours down, Upon the pallid inmates of the mortuary, And on the neighbouring outskirts of the town.
My wasted cat, in searching for a litter, Bestirs its mangy paws from post to post; (A poet's soul that wanders in the gutter, With the jaded voice of a shiv'ring ghost).
The smoking pine-log, while the drone laments, Accompanies the wheezy pendulum, The while amidst a haze of dirty scents, —Those fatal remnants of a sick man's room— The gallant knave of hearts and queen of spades Relate their ancient amorous escapades."
Obsession,"Great forests, you alarm me like a mighty fane; Like organ-tones you roar, and in our hearts of stone, Where ancient sobs vibrate, O halls of endless pain!
The answering echoes of your ""De Profundis"" moan.
I hate thee, Ocean! hate thy tumults and thy throbs, My spirit finds them in himself.
This bitter glee Of vanquished mortals, full of insults and of sobs, I hear it in the mighteous laughter of the sea.
O starless night! thy loveliness my soul inhales, Without those starry rays which speak a language known, For I desire the dark, the naked and the lone.
But e'en those darknesses themselves to me are veils, Where live—and, by the millions 'neath my eyelids prance, Long, long departed Beings with familiar glance."
Magnetic Horror,"""Beneath this sky, so livid and strange, Tormented like thy destiny, What thoughts within thy spirit range Themselves?—O libertine reply."" —With vain desires, for ever torn Towards the uncertain, and the vast, And yet, like Ovid—I'll not mourn— Who from his Roman Heaven was cast.
O heavens, turbulent as the streams, In you I mirror forth my pride!
Your clouds, which clad in mourning, glide, Are the hearses of my dreams, And in your illusion lies the hell, Wherein my heart delights to dwell."
The Lid,"Where'er he may rove, upon sea or on land, 'Neath a fiery sky or a pallid sun, Be he Christian or one of Cythera's band, Opulent Croesus or beggar—'tis one, Whether citizen, peasant or vagabond he, Be his little brain active or dull.
Everywhere, Man feels the terror of mystery, And looks upon high with a glance full of fear.
The Heaven above, that oppressive wall; A ceiling lit up in some lewd music hall, Where the actors step forth on a blood-red soil; The eremite's hope, and the dread of the sot, The Sky; that black lid of a mighty pot, Where, vast and minute, human Races boil."
Bertha's Eyes,"The loveliest eyes you can scorn with your wondrous glow: O! beautiful childish eyes there abounds in your light, A something unspeakably tender and good as the night: O! eyes! over me your enchanting darkness let flow.
Large eyes of my child!
O Arcana profoundly adored!
Ye resemble so closely those caves in the magical creek; Where within the deep slumbering shade of some petrified peak, There shines, undiscovered, the gems of a dazzling hoard.
My child has got eyes so profound and so dark and so vast, Like thee! oh unending Night, and thy mystical shine: Their flames are those thoughts that with Love and with Faith combine, And sparkle deep down in the depths so alluring or chaste."
The Set of the Romantic Sun,"How beauteous the sun as it rises supreme, Like an explosion that greets us from above, Oh, happy is he that can hail with love, Its decline, more glorious far, than a dream.
I saw flower, furrow, and brook....
I recall How they swooned like a tremulous heart 'neath the sun, Let us haste to the sky-line, 'tis late, let us run, At least to catch one slanting ray ere it fall.
But the god, who eludes me, I chase all in vain, The night, irresistible, plants its domain, Black mists and vague shivers of death it forbodes; While an odour of graves through the darkness spreads, And on the swamp's margin, my timid foot treads Upon slimy snails, and on unseen toads."
Meditation,"Be wise, O my Woe, seek thy grievance to drown, Thou didst call for the night, and behold it is here, An atmosphere sombre, envelopes the town, To some bringing peace and to others a care.
Whilst the manifold souls of the vile multitude, 'Neath the lash of enjoyment, that merciless sway, Go plucking remorse from the menial brood, From them far, O my grief, hold my hand, come this way.
Behold how they beckon, those years, long expired, From Heaven, in faded apparel attired, How Regret, smiling, foams on the waters like yeast; Its arches of slumber the dying sun spreads, And like a long winding-sheet dragged to the East, Oh, hearken Beloved, how the Night softly treads!"
To a Passer-by,"Around me thundered the deafening noise of the street, In mourning apparel, portraying majestic distress, With queenly fingers, just lifting the hem of her dress, A stately woman passed by with hurrying feet.
Agile and noble, with limbs of perfect poise, Ah, how I drank, thrilled through like a Being insane, In her look, a dark sky, from whence springs forth the hurricane, There lay but the sweetness that charms, and the joy that destroys.
A flash—then the night....
O loveliness fugitive!
Whose glance has so suddenly caused me again to live, Shall I not see you again till this life is o'er!
Elsewhere, far away ... too late, perhaps never more, For I know not whither you fly, nor you, where I go, O soul that I would have loved, and that you know!"
Illusionary Love,"When I behold thee wander by, my languorous love, To songs of viols which throughout the dome resound, Harmonious and stately as thy footsteps move, Bestowing forth the languor of thy glance profound.
When I regard thee, glowing in the gaslight rays, Thy pallid brow embellished by a charm obscure, Here where the evening torches light the twilight haze, Thine eyes attracting me like those of a portraiture, I say—How beautiful she is! how strangely rich!
A mighty memory, royal and commanding tower, A garland: and her heart, bruised like a ruddy peach, Is ripe—like her body for Love's sapient power.
Art thou, that spicy Autumn-fruit with taste supreme?
Art thou a funeral vase inviting tears of grief?
Aroma—causing one of Eastern wastes to dream; A downy cushion, bunch of flowers or golden sheaf?
I know that there are eyes, most melancholy ones, Wherein no precious secret deeply hidden lies, Resplendent shrines, devoid of relics, sacred stones, More empty, more profound than ye yourselves, O skies?
Yea, does thy semblance, not alone for me suffice, To kindle senses which the cruel truth abhor?
All one to me! thy folly or thy heart of ice, Decoy or mask, all hail! thy beauty I adore!"
Mists and Rains,"O last of Autumn and Winter—steeped in haze, O sleepy seasons! you I love and praise, Because around my heart and brain you twine A misty winding-sheet and a nebulous shrine.
On that great plain, where frigid blasts abound, Where through the nights, so long, the vane whirls round, My soul, more free than in the springtime soft, Will stretch her raven wings and soar aloft, Unto an heart with gloomy things replete, On which remain the frosts of former Times, O pallid seasons, mistress of our climes As your pale shadows—nothing is so sweet, Unless it be, on a moonless night a-twain, On some chance couch to soothe to sleep our Pain."
The Wine of Lovers,"To-day the Distance is superb, Without bridle, spur or curb, Let us mount on the back of wine For Regions fairy and divine!
Let's, like two angels tortured by Some dark, delirious phantasy, Pursue the distant mirage drawn O'er the blue crystal of the dawn!
And gently balanced on the wing Of some obliging whirlwind, we —In equal rapture revelling— My sister, side by side will flee, Without repose, nor truce, where gleams The golden Paradise of my dreams!"
Condemned Women,"Like thoughtful cattle on the yellow sands reclined, They turn their eyes towards the horizon of the sea, Their feet towards each other stretched, their hands entwined, They tell of gentle yearning, frigid misery.
A few, with heart-confiding faith of old, imbued Amid the darkling grove, where silver streamlets flow, Unfold to each their loves of tender infanthood, And carve the verdant stems of the vine-kissed portico.
And others like unto nuns with footsteps slow and grave, Ascend the hallowed rocks of ancient mystic lore, Where long ago—St.
Anthony, like a surging wave, The naked purpled breasts of his temptation saw.
And still some more, that 'neath the shimmering masses stroll, Among the silent chasm of some pagan caves, To soothe their burning fevers unto thee they call O Bacchus! who all ancient wounds and sorrow laves.
And others again, whose necks in scapulars delight, Who hide a whip beneath their garments secretly, Commingling, in the sombre wood and lonesome night, The foam of torments and of tears with ecstasy.
O virgins, demons, monsters, and O martyred brood!
Great souls that mock Reality with remorseless sneers, O saints and satyrs, searchers for infinitude!
At times so full of shouts, at times so full of tears!
You, to whom within your hell my spirit flies, Poor sisters—yea, I love you as I pity you, For your unsatiated thirsts and anguished sighs, And for the vials of love within your hearts so true."
The Death of the Lovers,"We will have beds which exhale odours soft, We will have divans profound as the tomb, And delicate plants on the ledges aloft, Which under the bluest of skies for us bloom.
Exhausting our hearts to their last desires, They both shall be like unto two glowing coals, Reflecting the twofold light of their fires Across the twin mirrors of our two souls.
One evening of mystical azure skies, We'll exchange but one single lightning flash, Just like a long sob—replete with good byes.
And later an angel shall joyously pass Through the half-open doors, to replenish and wash The torches expired, and the tarnished glass."

PART I.,"Upon a time, before the faery broods Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods, Before King Oberon's bright diadem, Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem, Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns, The ever-smitten Hermes empty left His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft: [ 4 ] From high Olympus had he stolen light, On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight 10 Of his great summoner, and made retreat Into a forest on the shores of Crete.
For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt; At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured Pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored.
Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont, And in those meads where sometime she might haunt, Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse, Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose. 20 Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!
So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat Burnt from his winged heels to either ear, That from a whiteness, as the lily clear, Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair, Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare. [ 5 ] From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew, Breathing upon the flowers his passion new, And wound with many a river to its head, To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed: 30 In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found, And so he rested, on the lonely ground, Pensive, and full of painful jealousies Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.
There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice, Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake: ""When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!
When move in a sweet body fit for life, And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife 40 Of hearts and lips!
Ah, miserable me!"" The God, dove-footed, glided silently Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed, The taller grasses and full-flowering weed, [ 6 ] Until he found a palpitating snake, Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.
She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue, Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue; Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard, Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd; 50 And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed, Dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries— So rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries, She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf, Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self.
Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar: Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!
She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete: 60 And for her eyes: what could such eyes do there [ 7 ] But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?
As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air.
Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love's sake, And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay, Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey. ""Fair Hermes, crown'd with feathers, fluttering light, I had a splendid dream of thee last night: I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold, 70 Among the Gods, upon Olympus old, The only sad one; for thou didst not hear The soft, lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear, Nor even Apollo when he sang alone, Deaf to his throbbing throat's long, long melodious moan.
I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes, Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks, [ 8 ] And, swiftly as a bright Phœbean dart, Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art!
Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?"" 80 Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired: ""Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent, surely high inspired!
Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes, Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise, Telling me only where my nymph is fled,— Where she doth breathe!"" ""Bright planet, thou hast said,"" Return'd the snake, ""but seal with oaths, fair God!"" ""I swear,"" said Hermes, ""by my serpent rod, And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!"" 90 Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown.
Then thus again the brilliance feminine: ""Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine, [ 9 ] Free as the air, invisibly, she strays About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet; From weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green, She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen: And by my power is her beauty veil'd 100 To keep it unaffronted, unassail'd By the love-glances of unlovely eyes, Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear'd Silenus' sighs.
Pale grew her immortality, for woe Of all these lovers, and she grieved so I took compassion on her, bade her steep Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep Her loveliness invisible, yet free To wander as she loves, in liberty.
Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone, 110 If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!"" [ 10 ] Then, once again, the charmed God began An oath, and through the serpent's ears it ran Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian.
Ravish'd, she lifted her Circean head, Blush'd a live damask, and swift-lisping said, ""I was a woman, let me have once more A woman's shape, and charming as before.
I love a youth of Corinth—O the bliss!
Give me my woman's form, and place me where he is. 120 Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow, And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now."" The God on half-shut feathers sank serene, She breath'd upon his eyes, and swift was seen Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.
It was no dream; or say a dream it was, Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass Their pleasures in a long immortal dream.
One warm, flush'd moment, hovering, it might seem [ 11 ] Dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty, so he burn'd; 130 Then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn'd To the swoon'd serpent, and with languid arm, Delicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm.
So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent Full of adoring tears and blandishment, And towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane, Faded before him, cower'd, nor could restrain Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower That faints into itself at evening hour: But the God fostering her chilled hand, 140 She felt the warmth, her eyelids open'd bland, And, like new flowers at morning song of bees, Bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees.
Into the green-recessed woods they flew; Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do.
Left to herself, the serpent now began To change; her elfin blood in madness ran, [ 12 ] Her mouth foam'd, and the grass, therewith besprent, Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent; Her eyes in torture fix'd, and anguish drear, 150 Hot, glaz'd, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear, Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear.
The colours all inflam'd throughout her train, She writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain: A deep volcanian yellow took the place Of all her milder-mooned body's grace; And, as the lava ravishes the mead, Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede; Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars, Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars: 160 So that, in moments few, she was undrest Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst, And rubious-argent: of all these bereft, Nothing but pain and ugliness were left. [ 13 ] Still shone her crown; that vanish'd, also she Melted and disappear'd as suddenly; And in the air, her new voice luting soft, Cried, ""Lycius! gentle Lycius!""—Borne aloft With the bright mists about the mountains hoar These words dissolv'd: Crete's forests heard no more. 170 Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright, A full-born beauty new and exquisite?
She fled into that valley they pass o'er Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore; And rested at the foot of those wild hills, The rugged founts of the Peræan rills, And of that other ridge whose barren back Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack, South-westward to Cleone.
There she stood About a young bird's flutter from a wood, 180 Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread, By a clear pool, wherein she passioned [ 14 ] To see herself escap'd from so sore ills, While her robes flaunted with the daffodils.
Ah, happy Lycius!—for she was a maid More beautiful than ever twisted braid, Or sigh'd, or blush'd, or on spring-flowered lea Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy: A virgin purest lipp'd, yet in the lore Of love deep learned to the red heart's core: 190 Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain; Define their pettish limits, and estrange Their points of contact, and swift counterchange; Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art; As though in Cupid's college she had spent Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent, And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment. [ 15 ] Why this fair creature chose so fairily 200 By the wayside to linger, we shall see; But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse And dream, when in the serpent prison-house, Of all she list, strange or magnificent: How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went; Whether to faint Elysium, or where Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair; Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine, Stretch'd out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine; 210 Or where in Pluto's gardens palatine Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line.
And sometimes into cities she would send Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend; And once, while among mortals dreaming thus, She saw the young Corinthian Lycius Charioting foremost in the envious race, Like a young Jove with calm uneager face, [ 16 ] And fell into a swooning love of him.
Now on the moth-time of that evening dim 220 He would return that way, as well she knew, To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew The eastern soft wind, and his galley now Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle Fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare.
Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire; For by some freakful chance he made retire 230 From his companions, and set forth to walk, Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk: Over the solitary hills he fared, Thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared His phantasy was lost, where reason fades, In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades. [ 17 ] Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near— Close to her passing, in indifference drear, His silent sandals swept the mossy green; So neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen 240 She stood: he pass'd, shut up in mysteries, His mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes Follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white Turn'd—syllabling thus, ""Ah, Lycius bright, And will you leave me on the hills alone?
Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown."" He did; not with cold wonder fearingly, But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice; For so delicious were the words she sung, It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long: 250 And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up, Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup, And still the cup was full,—while he, afraid Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid [ 18 ] Due adoration, thus began to adore; Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure: ""Leave thee alone!
Look back!
Ah, Goddess, see Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee!
For pity do not this sad heart belie— Even as thou vanishest so I shall die. 260 Stay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay!
To thy far wishes will thy streams obey: Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain, Alone they can drink up the morning rain: Though a descended Pleiad, will not one Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine?
So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade Thy memory will waste me to a shade:— 270 For pity do not melt!""—""If I should stay,"" Said Lamia, ""here, upon this floor of clay, [ 19 ] And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough, What canst thou say or do of charm enough To dull the nice remembrance of my home?
Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,— Empty of immortality and bliss!
Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know That finer spirits cannot breathe below 280 In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth, What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe My essence?
What serener palaces, Where I may all my many senses please, And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease?
It cannot be—Adieu!"" So said, she rose Tiptoe with white arms spread.
He, sick to lose The amorous promise of her lone complain, Swoon'd, murmuring of love, and pale with pain. [ 20 ] The cruel lady, without any show 290 Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe, But rather, if her eyes could brighter be, With brighter eyes and slow amenity, Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh The life she had so tangled in her mesh: And as he from one trance was wakening Into another, she began to sing, Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing, A song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres, While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires. 300 And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone, As those who, safe together met alone For the first time through many anguish'd days, Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt, For that she was a woman, and without [ 21 ] Any more subtle fluid in her veins Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his.
And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss 310 Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said, She dwelt but half retir'd, and there had led Days happy as the gold coin could invent Without the aid of love; yet in content Till she saw him, as once she pass'd him by, Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully At Venus' temple porch, 'mid baskets heap'd Of amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap'd Late on that eve, as 'twas the night before The Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more, 320 But wept alone those days, for why should she adore?
Lycius from death awoke into amaze, To see her still, and singing so sweet lays; [ 22 ] Then from amaze into delight he fell To hear her whisper woman's lore so well; And every word she spake entic'd him on To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known.
Let the mad poets say whate'er they please Of the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses, There is not such a treat among them all, 330 Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall, As a real woman, lineal indeed From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed.
Thus gentle Lamia judg'd, and judg'd aright, That Lycius could not love in half a fright, So threw the goddess off, and won his heart More pleasantly by playing woman's part, With no more awe than what her beauty gave, That, while it smote, still guaranteed to save.
Lycius to all made eloquent reply, 340 Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh; [ 23 ] And last, pointing to Corinth, ask'd her sweet, If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet.
The way was short, for Lamia's eagerness Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease To a few paces; not at all surmised By blinded Lycius, so in her comprized.
They pass'd the city gates, he knew not how, So noiseless, and he never thought to know.
As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all, 350 Throughout her palaces imperial, And all her populous streets and temples lewd, Mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd, To the wide-spreaded night above her towers.
Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours, Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white, Companion'd or alone; while many a light Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals, And threw their moving shadows on the walls, [ 24 ] Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade 360 Of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonnade.
Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear, Her fingers he press'd hard, as one came near With curl'd gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown, Slow-stepp'd, and robed in philosophic gown: Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past, Into his mantle, adding wings to haste, While hurried Lamia trembled: ""Ah,"" said he, ""Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully?
Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?""— 370 ""I'm wearied,"" said fair Lamia: ""tell me who Is that old man?
I cannot bring to mind His features:—Lycius! wherefore did you blind Yourself from his quick eyes?"" Lycius replied, ""'Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide [ 25 ] And good instructor; but to-night he seems The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams."" While yet he spake they had arrived before A pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door, Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow 380 Reflected in the slabbed steps below, Mild as a star in water; for so new, And so unsullied was the marble hue, So through the crystal polish, liquid fine, Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine Could e'er have touch'd there.
Sounds Æolian Breath'd from the hinges, as the ample span Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown Some time to any, but those two alone, And a few Persian mutes, who that same year 390 Were seen about the markets: none knew where [ 26 ] They could inhabit; the most curious Were foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house: And but the flitter-winged verse must tell, For truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel, 'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus, Shut from the busy world of more incredulous. [ 27 ]"
PART II.,"Love in a hut, with water and a crust, Is—Love, forgive us!—cinders, ashes, dust; Love in a palace is perhaps at last More grievous torment than a hermit's fast:— That is a doubtful tale from faery land, Hard for the non-elect to understand.
Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down, He might have given the moral a fresh frown, Or clench'd it quite: but too short was their bliss To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss. 10 [ 28 ] Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair, Hover'd and buzz'd his wings, with fearful roar, Above the lintel of their chamber door, And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.
For all this came a ruin: side by side They were enthroned, in the even tide, Upon a couch, near to a curtaining Whose airy texture, from a golden string, Floated into the room, and let appear 20 Unveil'd the summer heaven, blue and clear, Betwixt two marble shafts:—there they reposed, Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed, Saving a tythe which love still open kept, That they might see each other while they almost slept; When from the slope side of a suburb hill, Deafening the swallow's twitter, came a thrill [ 29 ] Of trumpets—Lycius started—the sounds fled, But left a thought, a buzzing in his head.
For the first time, since first he harbour'd in 30 That purple-lined palace of sweet sin, His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn Into the noisy world almost forsworn.
The lady, ever watchful, penetrant, Saw this with pain, so arguing a want Of something more, more than her empery Of joys; and she began to moan and sigh Because he mused beyond her, knowing well That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell. ""Why do you sigh, fair creature?"" whisper'd he: 40 ""Why do you think?"" return'd she tenderly: ""You have deserted me;—where am I now?
Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow: No, no, you have dismiss'd me; and I go From your breast houseless: ay, it must be so."" [ 30 ] He answer'd, bending to her open eyes, Where he was mirror'd small in paradise, ""My silver planet, both of eve and morn!
Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn, While I am striving how to fill my heart 50 With deeper crimson, and a double smart?
How to entangle, trammel up and snare Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?
Ay, a sweet kiss—you see your mighty woes.
My thoughts! shall I unveil them?
Listen then!
What mortal hath a prize, that other men May be confounded and abash'd withal, But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical, And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice 60 Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice.
Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar, While through the thronged streets your bridal car [ 31 ] Wheels round its dazzling spokes.""—The lady's cheek Trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek, Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain Of sorrows at his words; at last with pain Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung, To change his purpose.
He thereat was stung, Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim 70 Her wild and timid nature to his aim: Besides, for all his love, in self despite, Against his better self, he took delight Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.
His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.
Fine was the mitigated fury, like Apollo's presence when in act to strike The serpent—Ha, the serpent! certes, she 80 Was none.
She burnt, she lov'd the tyranny, [ 32 ] And, all subdued, consented to the hour When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.
Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth, ""Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth, I have not ask'd it, ever thinking thee Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny, As still I do.
Hast any mortal name, Fit appellation for this dazzling frame?
Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth, 90 To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?"" ""I have no friends,"" said Lamia, ""no, not one; My presence in wide Corinth hardly known: My parents' bones are in their dusty urns Sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns, Seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me, And I neglect the holy rite for thee.
Even as you list invite your many guests; But if, as now it seems, your vision rests [ 33 ] With any pleasure on me, do not bid 100 Old Apollonius—from him keep me hid."" Lycius, perplex'd at words so blind and blank, Made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank, Feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd.
It was the custom then to bring away The bride from home at blushing shut of day, Veil'd, in a chariot, heralded along By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song, With other pageants: but this fair unknown 110 Had not a friend.
So being left alone, (Lycius was gone to summon all his kin) And knowing surely she could never win His foolish heart from its mad pompousness, She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress [ 34 ] The misery in fit magnificence.
She did so, but 'tis doubtful how and whence Came, and who were her subtle servitors.
About the halls, and to and from the doors, There was a noise of wings, till in short space 120 The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.
A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.
Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade Of palm and plantain, met from either side, High in the midst, in honour of the bride: Two palms and then two plantains, and so on, From either side their stems branch'd one to one All down the aisled place; and beneath all 130 There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall. [ 35 ] So canopied, lay an untasted feast Teeming with odours.
Lamia, regal drest, Silently paced about, and as she went, In pale contented sort of discontent, Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich The fretted splendour of each nook and niche.
Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first, Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees, 140 And with the larger wove in small intricacies.
Approving all, she faded at self-will, And shut the chamber up, close, hush'd and still, Complete and ready for the revels rude, When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.
The day appear'd, and all the gossip rout.
O senseless Lycius!
Madman! wherefore flout [ 36 ] The silent-blessing fate, warm cloister'd hours, And show to common eyes these secret bowers?
The herd approach'd; each guest, with busy brain, 150 Arriving at the portal, gaz'd amain, And enter'd marveling: for they knew the street, Remember'd it from childhood all complete Without a gap, yet ne'er before had seen That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne; So in they hurried all, maz'd, curious and keen: Save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe, And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere; 'Twas Apollonius: something too he laugh'd, As though some knotty problem, that had daft 160 His patient thought, had now begun to thaw, And solve and melt:—'twas just as he foresaw.
He met within the murmurous vestibule His young disciple. ""'Tis no common rule, [ 37 ] Lycius,"" said he, ""for uninvited guest To force himself upon you, and infest With an unbidden presence the bright throng Of younger friends; yet must I do this wrong, And you forgive me."" Lycius blush'd, and led The old man through the inner doors broad-spread; 170 With reconciling words and courteous mien Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen.
Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room, Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume: Before each lucid pannel fuming stood A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood, Each by a sacred tripod held aloft, Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft Wool-woofed carpets: fifty wreaths of smoke From fifty censers their light voyage took 180 [ 38 ] To the high roof, still mimick'd as they rose Along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous.
Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered, High as the level of a man's breast rear'd On libbard's paws, upheld the heavy gold Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told Of Ceres' horn, and, in huge vessels, wine Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine.
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood, Each shrining in the midst the image of a God. 190 When in an antichamber every guest Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd, By minist'ring slaves, upon his hands and feet, And fragrant oils with ceremony meet Pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast In white robes, and themselves in order placed [ 39 ] Around the silken couches, wondering Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.
Soft went the music the soft air along, While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong 200 Kept up among the guests, discoursing low At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow; But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains, Louder they talk, and louder come the strains Of powerful instruments:—the gorgeous dyes, The space, the splendour of the draperies, The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer, Beautiful slaves, and Lamia's self, appear, Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed, And every soul from human trammels freed, 210 No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine, Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine. [ 40 ] Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height; Flush'd were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright: Garlands of every green, and every scent From vales deflower'd, or forest-trees branch-rent, In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought High as the handles heap'd, to suit the thought Of every guest; that each, as he did please, Might fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow'd at his ease. 220 What wreath for Lamia?
What for Lycius?
What for the sage, old Apollonius?
Upon her aching forehead be there hung The leaves of willow and of adder's tongue; And for the youth, quick, let us strip for him The thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim Into forgetfulness; and, for the sage, Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage [ 41 ] War on his temples.
Do not all charms fly At the mere touch of cold philosophy? 230 There was an awful rainbow once in heaven: We know her woof, her texture; she is given In the dull catalogue of common things.
Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings, Conquer all mysteries by rule and line, Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine— Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade.
By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place, Scarce saw in all the room another face, 240 Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took Full brimm'd, and opposite sent forth a look 'Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance From his old teacher's wrinkled countenance, [ 42 ] And pledge him.
The bald-head philosopher Had fix'd his eye, without a twinkle or stir Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride, Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.
Lycius then press'd her hand, with devout touch, As pale it lay upon the rosy couch: 250 'Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins; Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart. ""Lamia, what means this?
Wherefore dost thou start?
Know'st thou that man?"" Poor Lamia answer'd not.
He gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal: More, more he gaz'd: his human senses reel: Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs; There was no recognition in those orbs. 260 [ 43 ] ""Lamia!"" he cried—and no soft-toned reply.
The many heard, and the loud revelry Grew hush; the stately music no more breathes; The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths.
By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased; A deadly silence step by step increased, Until it seem'd a horrid presence there, And not a man but felt the terror in his hair. ""Lamia!"" he shriek'd; and nothing but the shriek With its sad echo did the silence break. 270 ""Begone, foul dream!"" he cried, gazing again In the bride's face, where now no azure vein Wander'd on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom Misted the cheek; no passion to illume The deep-recessed vision:—all was blight; Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white. ""Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!
Turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban [ 44 ] Of all the Gods, whose dreadful images Here represent their shadowy presences, 280 May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn Of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn, In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright Of conscience, for their long offended might, For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries, Unlawful magic, and enticing lies.
Corinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!
Mark how, possess'd, his lashless eyelids stretch Around his demon eyes!
Corinthians, see!
My sweet bride withers at their potency."" 290 ""Fool!"" said the sophist, in an under-tone Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan From Lycius answer'd, as heart-struck and lost, He sank supine beside the aching ghost. ""Fool!
Fool!"" repeated he, while his eyes still Relented not, nor mov'd; ""from every ill [ 45 ] Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day, And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey?"" Then Lamia breath'd death breath; the sophist's eye, Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly, 300 Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well As her weak hand could any meaning tell, Motion'd him to be silent; vainly so, He look'd and look'd again a level—No! ""A Serpent!"" echoed he; no sooner said, Than with a frightful scream she vanished: And Lycius' arms were empty of delight, As were his limbs of life, from that same night.
On the high couch he lay!—his friends came round— Supported him—no pulse, or breath they found, 310 And, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound. [45:A] [ 46 ]"
FOOTNOTES:,"[45:A] ""Philostratus, in his fourth book de Vita Apollonii , hath a memorable instance in this kind, which I may not omit, of one Menippus Lycius, a young man twenty-five years of age, that going betwixt Cenchreas and Corinth, met such a phantasm in the habit of a fair gentlewoman, which taking him by the hand, carried him home to her house, in the suburbs of Corinth, and told him she was a Phœnician by birth, and if he would tarry with her, he should hear her sing and play, and drink such wine as never any drank, and no man should molest him; but she, being fair and lovely, would live and die with him, that was fair and lovely to behold.
The young man, a philosopher, otherwise staid and discreet, able to moderate his passions, though not this of love, tarried with her a while to his great content, and at last married her, to whose wedding, amongst other guests, came Apollonius; who, by some probable conjectures, found her out to be a serpent, a lamia; and that all her furniture was, like Tantalus' gold, described by Homer, no substance but mere illusions.
When she saw herself descried, she wept, and desired Apollonius to be silent, but he would not be moved, and thereupon she, plate, house, and all that was in it, vanished in an instant: many thousands took notice of this fact, for it was done in the midst of Greece.""

Subs. 1. [ 47 ] ISABELLA; OR, THE POT OF BASIL.
A STORY FROM BOCCACCIO. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] I.
Fair Isabel, poor simple Isabel!
Lorenzo, a young palmer in Love's eye!
They could not in the self-same mansion dwell Without some stir of heart, some malady; They could not sit at meals but feel how well It soothed each to be the other by; They could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep But to each other dream, and nightly weep. [ 50 ] II.
With every morn their love grew tenderer, With every eve deeper and tenderer still; 10 He might not in house, field, or garden stir, But her full shape would all his seeing fill; And his continual voice was pleasanter To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill; Her lute-string gave an echo of his name, She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.
III.
He knew whose gentle hand was at the latch, Before the door had given her to his eyes; And from her chamber-window he would catch Her beauty farther than the falcon spies; 20 And constant as her vespers would he watch, Because her face was turn'd to the same skies; And with sick longing all the night outwear, To hear her morning-step upon the stair. [ 51 ] IV.
A whole long month of May in this sad plight Made their cheeks paler by the break of June: ""To-morrow will I bow to my delight, To-morrow will I ask my lady's boon.""— ""O may I never see another night, Lorenzo, if thy lips breathe not love's tune.""— 30 So spake they to their pillows; but, alas, Honeyless days and days did he let pass; V.
Until sweet Isabella's untouch'd cheek Fell sick within the rose's just domain, Fell thin as a young mother's, who doth seek By every lull to cool her infant's pain: ""How ill she is,"" said he, ""I may not speak, And yet I will, and tell my love all plain: If looks speak love-laws, I will drink her tears, And at the least 'twill startle off her cares."" 40 [ 52 ] VI.
So said he one fair morning, and all day His heart beat awfully against his side; And to his heart he inwardly did pray For power to speak; but still the ruddy tide Stifled his voice, and puls'd resolve away— Fever'd his high conceit of such a bride, Yet brought him to the meekness of a child: Alas! when passion is both meek and wild!
VII.
So once more he had wak'd and anguished A dreary night of love and misery, 50 If Isabel's quick eye had not been wed To every symbol on his forehead high; She saw it waxing very pale and dead, And straight all flush'd; so, lisped tenderly, ""Lorenzo!""—here she ceas'd her timid quest, But in her tone and look he read the rest. [ 53 ] VIII. ""O Isabella, I can half perceive That I may speak my grief into thine ear; If thou didst ever any thing believe, Believe how I love thee, believe how near 60 My soul is to its doom: I would not grieve Thy hand by unwelcome pressing, would not fear Thine eyes by gazing; but I cannot live Another night, and not my passion shrive.
IX. ""Love! thou art leading me from wintry cold, Lady! thou leadest me to summer clime, And I must taste the blossoms that unfold In its ripe warmth this gracious morning time."" So said, his erewhile timid lips grew bold, And poesied with hers in dewy rhyme: 70 Great bliss was with them, and great happiness Grew, like a lusty flower in June's caress. [ 54 ] X.
Parting they seem'd to tread upon the air, Twin roses by the zephyr blown apart Only to meet again more close, and share The inward fragrance of each other's heart.
She, to her chamber gone, a ditty fair Sang, of delicious love and honey'd dart; He with light steps went up a western hill, And bade the sun farewell, and joy'd his fill. 80 XI.
All close they met again, before the dusk Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil, All close they met, all eyes, before the dusk Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil, Close in a bower of hyacinth and musk, Unknown of any, free from whispering tale.
Ah! better had it been for ever so, Than idle ears should pleasure in their woe. [ 55 ] XII.
Were they unhappy then?—It cannot be— Too many tears for lovers have been shed, 90 Too many sighs give we to them in fee, Too much of pity after they are dead, Too many doleful stories do we see, Whose matter in bright gold were best be read; Except in such a page where Theseus' spouse Over the pathless waves towards him bows.
XIII.
But, for the general award of love, The little sweet doth kill much bitterness; Though Dido silent is in under-grove, And Isabella's was a great distress, 100 Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove Was not embalm'd, this truth is not the less— Even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers, Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers. [ 56 ] XIV.
With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt, Enriched from ancestral merchandize, And for them many a weary hand did swelt In torched mines and noisy factories, And many once proud-quiver'd loins did melt In blood from stinging whip;—with hollow eyes 110 Many all day in dazzling river stood, To take the rich-ored driftings of the flood.
XV.
For them the Ceylon diver held his breath, And went all naked to the hungry shark; For them his ears gush'd blood; for them in death The seal on the cold ice with piteous bark Lay full of darts; for them alone did seethe A thousand men in troubles wide and dark: Half-ignorant, they turn'd an easy wheel, That set sharp racks at work, to pinch and peel. 120 [ 57 ] XVI.
Why were they proud?
Because their marble founts Gush'd with more pride than do a wretch's tears?— Why were they proud?
Because fair orange-mounts Were of more soft ascent than lazar stairs?— Why were they proud?
Because red-lin'd accounts Were richer than the songs of Grecian years?— Why were they proud? again we ask aloud, Why in the name of Glory were they proud?
XVII.
Yet were these Florentines as self-retired In hungry pride and gainful cowardice, 130 As two close Hebrews in that land inspired, Paled in and vineyarded from beggar-spies; The hawks of ship-mast forests—the untired And pannier'd mules for ducats and old lies— Quick cat's-paws on the generous stray-away,— Great wits in Spanish, Tuscan, and Malay. [ 58 ] XVIII.
How was it these same ledger-men could spy Fair Isabella in her downy nest?
How could they find out in Lorenzo's eye A straying from his toil?
Hot Egypt's pest 140 Into their vision covetous and sly!
How could these money-bags see east and west?— Yet so they did—and every dealer fair Must see behind, as doth the hunted hare.
XIX.
O eloquent and famed Boccaccio!
Of thee we now should ask forgiving boon; And of thy spicy myrtles as they blow, And of thy roses amorous of the moon, And of thy lilies, that do paler grow Now they can no more hear thy ghittern's tune, 150 For venturing syllables that ill beseem The quiet glooms of such a piteous theme. [ 59 ] XX.
Grant thou a pardon here, and then the tale Shall move on soberly, as it is meet; There is no other crime, no mad assail To make old prose in modern rhyme more sweet: But it is done—succeed the verse or fail— To honour thee, and thy gone spirit greet; To stead thee as a verse in English tongue, An echo of thee in the north-wind sung. 160 XXI.
These brethren having found by many signs What love Lorenzo for their sister had, And how she lov'd him too, each unconfines His bitter thoughts to other, well nigh mad That he, the servant of their trade designs, Should in their sister's love be blithe and glad, When 'twas their plan to coax her by degrees To some high noble and his olive-trees. [ 60 ] XXII.
And many a jealous conference had they, And many times they bit their lips alone, 170 Before they fix'd upon a surest way To make the youngster for his crime atone; And at the last, these men of cruel clay Cut Mercy with a sharp knife to the bone; For they resolved in some forest dim To kill Lorenzo, and there bury him.
XXIII.
So on a pleasant morning, as he leant Into the sun-rise, o'er the balustrade Of the garden-terrace, towards him they bent Their footing through the dews; and to him said, 180 ""You seem there in the quiet of content, Lorenzo, and we are most loth to invade Calm speculation; but if you are wise, Bestride your steed while cold is in the skies. [ 61 ] XXIV. ""To-day we purpose, ay, this hour we mount To spur three leagues towards the Apennine; Come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count His dewy rosary on the eglantine."" Lorenzo, courteously as he was wont, Bow'd a fair greeting to these serpents' whine; 190 And went in haste, to get in readiness, With belt, and spur, and bracing huntsman's dress.
XXV.
And as he to the court-yard pass'd along, Each third step did he pause, and listen'd oft If he could hear his lady's matin-song, Or the light whisper of her footstep soft; And as he thus over his passion hung, He heard a laugh full musical aloft; When, looking up, he saw her features bright Smile through an in-door lattice, all delight. 200 [ 62 ] XXVI. ""Love, Isabel!"" said he, ""I was in pain Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow Ah! what if I should lose thee, when so fain I am to stifle all the heavy sorrow Of a poor three hours' absence? but we'll gain Out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow.
Goodbye!
I'll soon be back.""—""Goodbye!"" said she:— And as he went she chanted merrily.
XXVII.
So the two brothers and their murder'd man Rode past fair Florence, to where Arno's stream 210 Gurgles through straiten'd banks, and still doth fan Itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream Keeps head against the freshets.
Sick and wan The brothers' faces in the ford did seem, Lorenzo's flush with love.—They pass'd the water Into a forest quiet for the slaughter. [ 63 ] XXVIII.
There was Lorenzo slain and buried in, There in that forest did his great love cease; Ah! when a soul doth thus its freedom win, It aches in loneliness—is ill at peace 220 As the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin: They dipp'd their swords in the water, and did tease Their horses homeward, with convulsed spur, Each richer by his being a murderer.
XXIX.
They told their sister how, with sudden speed, Lorenzo had ta'en ship for foreign lands, Because of some great urgency and need In their affairs, requiring trusty hands.
Poor Girl! put on thy stifling widow's weed, And 'scape at once from Hope's accursed bands; 230 To-day thou wilt not see him, nor to-morrow, And the next day will be a day of sorrow. [ 64 ] XXX.
She weeps alone for pleasures not to be; Sorely she wept until the night came on, And then, instead of love, O misery!
She brooded o'er the luxury alone: His image in the dusk she seem'd to see, And to the silence made a gentle moan, Spreading her perfect arms upon the air, And on her couch low murmuring ""Where?
O where?"" 240 XXXI.
But Selfishness, Love's cousin, held not long Its fiery vigil in her single breast; She fretted for the golden hour, and hung Upon the time with feverish unrest— Not long—for soon into her heart a throng Of higher occupants, a richer zest, Came tragic; passion not to be subdued, And sorrow for her love in travels rude. [ 65 ] XXXII.
In the mid days of autumn, on their eves The breath of Winter comes from far away, 250 And the sick west continually bereaves Of some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay Of death among the bushes and the leaves, To make all bare before he dares to stray From his north cavern.
So sweet Isabel By gradual decay from beauty fell, XXXIII.
Because Lorenzo came not.
Oftentimes She ask'd her brothers, with an eye all pale, Striving to be itself, what dungeon climes Could keep him off so long?
They spake a tale 260 Time after time, to quiet her.
Their crimes Came on them, like a smoke from Hinnom's vale; And every night in dreams they groan'd aloud, To see their sister in her snowy shroud. [ 66 ] XXXIV.
And she had died in drowsy ignorance, But for a thing more deadly dark than all; It came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance, Which saves a sick man from the feather'd pall For some few gasping moments; like a lance, Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall 270 With cruel pierce, and bringing him again Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.
XXXV.
It was a vision.—In the drowsy gloom, The dull of midnight, at her couch's foot Lorenzo stood, and wept: the forest tomb Had marr'd his glossy hair which once could shoot Lustre into the sun, and put cold doom Upon his lips, and taken the soft lute From his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears Had made a miry channel for his tears. 280 [ 67 ] XXXVI.
Strange sound it was, when the pale shadow spake; For there was striving, in its piteous tongue, To speak as when on earth it was awake, And Isabella on its music hung: Languor there was in it, and tremulous shake, As in a palsied Druid's harp unstrung; And through it moan'd a ghostly under-song, Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.
XXXVII.
Its eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright With love, and kept all phantom fear aloof 290 From the poor girl by magic of their light, The while it did unthread the horrid woof Of the late darken'd time,—the murderous spite Of pride and avarice,—the dark pine roof In the forest,—and the sodden turfed dell, Where, without any word, from stabs he fell. [ 68 ] XXXVIII.
Saying moreover, ""Isabel, my sweet!
Red whortle-berries droop above my head, And a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet; Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed 300 Their leaves and prickly nuts; a sheep-fold bleat Comes from beyond the river to my bed: Go, shed one tear upon my heather-bloom, And it shall comfort me within the tomb.
XXXIX. ""I am a shadow now, alas! alas!
Upon the skirts of human-nature dwelling Alone: I chant alone the holy mass, While little sounds of life are round me knelling, And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass, And many a chapel bell the hour is telling, 310 Paining me through: those sounds grow strange to me, And thou art distant in Humanity. [ 69 ] XL. ""I know what was, I feel full well what is, And I should rage, if spirits could go mad; Though I forget the taste of earthly bliss, That paleness warms my grave, as though I had A Seraph chosen from the bright abyss To be my spouse: thy paleness makes me glad; Thy beauty grows upon me, and I feel A greater love through all my essence steal."" 320 XLI.
The Spirit mourn'd ""Adieu!""—dissolv'd, and left The atom darkness in a slow turmoil; As when of healthful midnight sleep bereft, Thinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil, We put our eyes into a pillowy cleft, And see the spangly gloom froth up and boil: It made sad Isabella's eyelids ache, And in the dawn she started up awake; [ 70 ] XLII. ""Ha! ha!"" said she, ""I knew not this hard life, I thought the worst was simple misery; 330 I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife Portion'd us—happy days, or else to die; But there is crime—a brother's bloody knife!
Sweet Spirit, thou hast school'd my infancy: I'll visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes, And greet thee morn and even in the skies."" XLIII.
When the full morning came, she had devised How she might secret to the forest hie; How she might find the clay, so dearly prized, And sing to it one latest lullaby; 340 How her short absence might be unsurmised, While she the inmost of the dream would try.
Resolv'd, she took with her an aged nurse, And went into that dismal forest-hearse. [ 71 ] XLIV.
See, as they creep along the river side, How she doth whisper to that aged Dame, And, after looking round the champaign wide, Shows her a knife.—""What feverous hectic flame Burns in thee, child?—What good can thee betide, That thou should'st smile again?""—The evening came, 350 And they had found Lorenzo's earthy bed; The flint was there, the berries at his head.
XLV.
Who hath not loiter'd in a green church-yard, And let his spirit, like a demon-mole, Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard, To see scull, coffin'd bones, and funeral stole; Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marr'd, And filling it once more with human soul?
Ah! this is holiday to what was felt When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt. 360 [ 72 ] XLVI.
She gaz'd into the fresh-thrown mould, as though One glance did fully all its secrets tell; Clearly she saw, as other eyes would know Pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well; Upon the murderous spot she seem'd to grow, Like to a native lily of the dell: Then with her knife, all sudden, she began To dig more fervently than misers can.
XLVII.
Soon she turn'd up a soiled glove, whereon Her silk had play'd in purple phantasies, 370 She kiss'd it with a lip more chill than stone, And put it in her bosom, where it dries And freezes utterly unto the bone Those dainties made to still an infant's cries: Then 'gan she work again; nor stay'd her care, But to throw back at times her veiling hair. [ 73 ] XLVIII.
That old nurse stood beside her wondering, Until her heart felt pity to the core At sight of such a dismal labouring, And so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar, 380 And put her lean hands to the horrid thing: Three hours they labour'd at this travail sore; At last they felt the kernel of the grave, And Isabella did not stamp and rave.
XLIX.
Ah! wherefore all this wormy circumstance?
Why linger at the yawning tomb so long?
O for the gentleness of old Romance, The simple plaining of a minstrel's song!
Fair reader, at the old tale take a glance, For here, in truth, it doth not well belong 390 To speak:—O turn thee to the very tale, And taste the music of that vision pale. [ 74 ] L.
With duller steel than the Perséan sword They cut away no formless monster's head, But one, whose gentleness did well accord With death, as life.
The ancient harps have said, Love never dies, but lives, immortal Lord: If Love impersonate was ever dead, Pale Isabella kiss'd it, and low moan'd. 'Twas love; cold,—dead indeed, but not dethroned. 400 LI.
In anxious secrecy they took it home, And then the prize was all for Isabel: She calm'd its wild hair with a golden comb, And all around each eye's sepulchral cell Pointed each fringed lash; the smeared loam With tears, as chilly as a dripping well, She drench'd away:—and still she comb'd, and kept Sighing all day—and still she kiss'd, and wept. [ 75 ] LII.
Then in a silken scarf,—sweet with the dews Of precious flowers pluck'd in Araby, 410 And divine liquids come with odorous ooze Through the cold serpent-pipe refreshfully,— She wrapp'd it up; and for its tomb did choose A garden-pot, wherein she laid it by, And cover'd it with mould, and o'er it set Sweet Basil, which her tears kept ever wet.
LIII.
And she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun, And she forgot the blue above the trees, And she forgot the dells where waters run, And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze; 420 She had no knowledge when the day was done, And the new morn she saw not: but in peace Hung over her sweet Basil evermore, And moisten'd it with tears unto the core. [ 76 ] LIV.
And so she ever fed it with thin tears, Whence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew, So that it smelt more balmy than its peers Of Basil-tufts in Florence; for it drew Nurture besides, and life, from human fears, From the fast mouldering head there shut from view: 430 So that the jewel, safely casketed, Came forth, and in perfumed leafits spread.
LV.
O Melancholy, linger here awhile!
O Music, Music, breathe despondingly!
O Echo, Echo, from some sombre isle, Unknown, Lethean, sigh to us—O sigh!
Spirits in grief, lift up your heads, and smile; Lift up your heads, sweet Spirits, heavily, And make a pale light in your cypress glooms, Tinting with silver wan your marble tombs. 440 [ 77 ] LVI.
Moan hither, all ye syllables of woe, From the deep throat of sad Melpomene!
Through bronzed lyre in tragic order go, And touch the strings into a mystery; Sound mournfully upon the winds and low; For simple Isabel is soon to be Among the dead: She withers, like a palm Cut by an Indian for its juicy balm.
LVII.
O leave the palm to wither by itself; Let not quick Winter chill its dying hour!— 450 It may not be—those Baälites of pelf, Her brethren, noted the continual shower From her dead eyes; and many a curious elf, Among her kindred, wonder'd that such dower Of youth and beauty should be thrown aside By one mark'd out to be a Noble's bride. [ 78 ] LVIII.
And, furthermore, her brethren wonder'd much Why she sat drooping by the Basil green, And why it flourish'd, as by magic touch; Greatly they wonder'd what the thing might mean: 460 They could not surely give belief, that such A very nothing would have power to wean Her from her own fair youth, and pleasures gay, And even remembrance of her love's delay.
LIX.
Therefore they watch'd a time when they might sift This hidden whim; and long they watch'd in vain; For seldom did she go to chapel-shrift, And seldom felt she any hunger-pain; And when she left, she hurried back, as swift As bird on wing to breast its eggs again; 470 And, patient, as a hen-bird, sat her there Beside her Basil, weeping through her hair. [ 79 ] LX.
Yet they contriv'd to steal the Basil-pot, And to examine it in secret place: The thing was vile with green and livid spot, And yet they knew it was Lorenzo's face: The guerdon of their murder they had got, And so left Florence in a moment's space, Never to turn again.—Away they went, With blood upon their heads, to banishment. 480 LXI.
O Melancholy, turn thine eyes away!
O Music, Music, breathe despondingly!
O Echo, Echo, on some other day, From isles Lethean, sigh to us—O sigh!
Spirits of grief, sing not your ""Well-a-way!"" For Isabel, sweet Isabel, will die; Will die a death too lone and incomplete, Now they have ta'en away her Basil sweet. [ 80 ] LXII.
Piteous she look'd on dead and senseless things, Asking for her lost Basil amorously; 490 And with melodious chuckle in the strings Of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry After the Pilgrim in his wanderings, To ask him where her Basil was; and why 'Twas hid from her: ""For cruel 'tis,"" said she, ""To steal my Basil-pot away from me."" LXIII.
And so she pined, and so she died forlorn, Imploring for her Basil to the last.
No heart was there in Florence but did mourn In pity of her love, so overcast. 500 And a sad ditty of this story born From mouth to mouth through all the country pass'd: Still is the burthen sung—""O cruelty, To steal my Basil-pot away from me!"" [ 81 ] THE EVE OF ST.
AGNES. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] I.
St.
Agnes' Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was!
The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold; The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass, And silent was the flock in woolly fold: Numb were the Beadsman's fingers, while he told His rosary, and while his frosted breath, Like pious incense from a censer old, Seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death, Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith. [ 84 ] II.
His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man; 10 Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees, And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan, Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees: The sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze, Emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails: Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries, He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.
III.
Northward he turneth through a little door, And scarce three steps, ere Music's golden tongue 20 Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor; But no—already had his deathbell rung; The joys of all his life were said and sung: His was harsh penance on St.
Agnes' Eve: Another way he went, and soon among Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve, And all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve. [ 85 ] IV.
That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft; And so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide, From hurry to and fro.
Soon, up aloft, 30 The silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide: The level chambers, ready with their pride, Were glowing to receive a thousand guests: The carved angels, ever eager-eyed, Star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests, With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.
V.
At length burst in the argent revelry, With plume, tiara, and all rich array, Numerous as shadows haunting fairily The brain, new stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay 40 Of old romance.
These let us wish away, And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there, Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day, On love, and wing'd St.
Agnes' saintly care, As she had heard old dames full many times declare. [ 86 ] VI.
They told her how, upon St.
Agnes' Eve, Young virgins might have visions of delight, And soft adorings from their loves receive Upon the honey'd middle of the night, If ceremonies due they did aright; 50 As, supperless to bed they must retire, And couch supine their beauties, lily white; Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.
VII.
Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline: The music, yearning like a God in pain, She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine, Fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train Pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier, 60 And back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain, But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere: She sigh'd for Agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year. [ 87 ] VIII.
She danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes, Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short: The hallow'd hour was near at hand: she sighs Amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort Of whisperers in anger, or in sport; 'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn, Hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort, 70 Save to St.
Agnes and her lambs unshorn, And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn.
IX.
So, purposing each moment to retire, She linger'd still.
Meantime, across the moors, Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire For Madeline.
Beside the portal doors, Buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores All saints to give him sight of Madeline, But for one moment in the tedious hours, That he might gaze and worship all unseen; 80 Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been. [ 88 ] X.
He ventures in: let no buzz'd whisper tell: All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords Will storm his heart, Love's fev'rous citadel: For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes, Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords, Whose very dogs would execrations howl Against his lineage: not one breast affords Him any mercy, in that mansion foul, Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul. 90 XI.
Ah, happy chance! the aged creature came, Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand, To where he stood, hid from the torch's flame, Behind a broad hall-pillar, far beyond The sound of merriment and chorus bland: He startled her; but soon she knew his face, And grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand, Saying, ""Mercy, Porphyro! hie thee from this place; They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!"" [ 89 ] XII. ""Get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish Hildebrand; 100 He had a fever late, and in the fit He cursed thee and thine, both house and land: Then there's that old Lord Maurice, not a whit More tame for his gray hairs—Alas me! flit!
Flit like a ghost away.""—""Ah, Gossip dear, We're safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit, And tell me how""—""Good Saints! not here, not here; Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier."" XIII.
He follow'd through a lowly arched way, Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume, 110 And as she mutter'd ""Well-a—well-a-day!"" He found him in a little moonlight room, Pale, lattic'd, chill, and silent as a tomb. ""Now tell me where is Madeline,"" said he, ""O tell me, Angela, by the holy loom Which none but secret sisterhood may see, When they St.
Agnes' wool are weaving piously."" [ 90 ] XIV. ""St.
Agnes!
Ah! it is St.
Agnes' Eve— Yet men will murder upon holy days: Thou must hold water in a witch's sieve, 120 And be liege-lord of all the Elves and Fays, To venture so: it fills me with amaze To see thee, Porphyro!—St.
Agnes' Eve!
God's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays This very night: good angels her deceive!
But let me laugh awhile, I've mickle time to grieve."" XV.
Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon, While Porphyro upon her face doth look, Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone Who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle-book, 130 As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.
But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told His lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old. [ 91 ] XVI.
Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart Made purple riot: then doth he propose A stratagem, that makes the beldame start: ""A cruel man and impious thou art: 140 Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream Alone with her good angels, far apart From wicked men like thee.
Go, go!—I deem Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem."" XVII. ""I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,"" Quoth Porphyro: ""O may I ne'er find grace When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer, If one of her soft ringlets I displace, Or look with ruffian passion in her face: Good Angela, believe me by these tears; 150 Or I will, even in a moment's space, Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears, And beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears."" [ 92 ] XVIII. ""Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?
A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing, Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll; Whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening, Were never miss'd.""—Thus plaining, doth she bring A gentler speech from burning Porphyro; So woful, and of such deep sorrowing, 160 That Angela gives promise she will do Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.
XIX.
Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy, Even to Madeline's chamber, and there hide Him in a closet, of such privacy That he might see her beauty unespied, And win perhaps that night a peerless bride, While legion'd fairies pac'd the coverlet, And pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed.
Never on such a night have lovers met, 170 Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt. [ 93 ] XX. ""It shall be as thou wishest,"" said the Dame: ""All cates and dainties shall be stored there Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare, For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare On such a catering trust my dizzy head.
Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed, Or may I never leave my grave among the dead."" 180 XXI.
So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.
The lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd; The dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear To follow her; with aged eyes aghast From fright of dim espial.
Safe at last, Through many a dusky gallery, they gain The maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd, and chaste; Where Porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain.
His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain. [ 94 ] XXII.
Her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade, 190 Old Angela was feeling for the stair, When Madeline, St.
Agnes' charmed maid, Rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware: With silver taper's light, and pious care, She turn'd, and down the aged gossip led To a safe level matting.
Now prepare, Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed; She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled.
XXIII.
Out went the taper as she hurried in; Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died: 200 She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin To spirits of the air, and visions wide: No uttered syllable, or, woe betide!
But to her heart, her heart was voluble, Paining with eloquence her balmy side; As though a tongueless nightingale should swell Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell. [ 95 ] XXIV.
A casement high and triple-arch'd there was, All garlanded with carven imag'ries Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass, 210 And diamonded with panes of quaint device, Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes, As are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings; And in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries, And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings, A shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings.
XXV.
Full on this casement shone the wintry moon, And threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast, As down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon; Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest, 220 And on her silver cross soft amethyst, And on her hair a glory, like a saint: She seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest, Save wings, for heaven:—Porphyro grew faint: She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint. [ 96 ] XXVI.
Anon his heart revives: her vespers done, Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees; Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one; Loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees: 230 Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed, Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees, In fancy, fair St.
Agnes in her bed, But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.
XXVII.
Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest, In sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay, Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd Her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away; Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day; Blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain; 240 Clasp'd like a missal where swart Paynims pray; Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain, As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again. [ 97 ] XXVIII.
Stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced, Porphyro gazed upon her empty dress, And listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced To wake into a slumberous tenderness; Which when he heard, that minute did he bless, And breath'd himself: then from the closet crept, Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness, 250 And over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept, And 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!—how fast she slept.
XXIX.
Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set A table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:— O for some drowsy Morphean amulet!
The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion, The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarionet, Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:— 260 The hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone. [ 98 ] XXX.
And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep, In blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd, While he from forth the closet brought a heap Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd With jellies soother than the creamy curd, And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon; Manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one, From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon. 270 XXXI.
These delicates he heap'd with glowing hand On golden dishes and in baskets bright Of wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand In the retired quiet of the night, Filling the chilly room with perfume light.— ""And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!
Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite: Open thine eyes, for meek St.
Agnes' sake, Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache."" [ 99 ] XXXII.
Thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm 280 Sank in her pillow.
Shaded was her dream By the dusk curtains:—'twas a midnight charm Impossible to melt as iced stream: The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam; Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies: It seem'd he never, never could redeem From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes; So mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies.
XXXIII.
Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,— Tumultuous,—and, in chords that tenderest be, 290 He play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute, In Provence call'd, ""La belle dame sans mercy:"" Close to her ear touching the melody;— Wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan: He ceased—she panted quick—and suddenly Her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone: Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone. [ 100 ] XXXIV.
Her eyes were open, but she still beheld, Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep: There was a painful change, that nigh expell'd 300 The blisses of her dream so pure and deep At which fair Madeline began to weep, And moan forth witless words with many a sigh; While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep; Who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye, Fearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly.
XXXV. ""Ah, Porphyro!"" said she, ""but even now Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear, Made tuneable with every sweetest vow; And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear: 310 How chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear!
Give me that voice again, my Porphyro, Those looks immortal, those complainings dear!
Oh leave me not in this eternal woe, For if thou diest, my Love, I know not where to go."" [ 101 ] XXXVI.
Beyond a mortal man impassion'd far At these voluptuous accents, he arose, Ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star Seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose Into her dream he melted, as the rose 320 Blendeth its odour with the violet,— Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows Like Love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet Against the window-panes; St.
Agnes' moon hath set.
XXXVII. 'Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet: ""This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!"" 'Tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat: ""No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!
Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.— Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring? 330 I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine Though thou forsakest a deceived thing;— A dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing."" [ 102 ] XXXVIII. ""My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!
Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?
Thy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed?
Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest After so many hours of toil and quest, A famish'd pilgrim,—saved by miracle.
Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest 340 Saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel."" XXXIX. ""Hark! 'tis an elfin-storm from faery land, Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed: Arise—arise! the morning is at hand;— The bloated wassaillers will never heed:— Let us away, my love, with happy speed; There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,— Drown'd all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead: Awake! arise! my love, and fearless be, 350 For o'er the southern moors I have a home for thee."" [ 103 ] XL.
She hurried at his words, beset with fears, For there were sleeping dragons all around, At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears— Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.— In all the house was heard no human sound.
A chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door; The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound, Flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar; And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor. 360 XLI.
They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall; Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide; Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl, With a huge empty flaggon by his side: The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide, But his sagacious eye an inmate owns: By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:— The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;— The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans. [ 104 ] XLII.
And they are gone: ay, ages long ago 370 These lovers fled away into the storm.
That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe, And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm, Were long be-nightmar'd.
Angela the old Died palsy-twitch'd, with meagre face deform; The Beadsman, after thousand aves told, For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold. [ 105 ] POEMS. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE. 1.
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, But being too happy in thine happiness,— That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees, In some melodious plot Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, Singest of summer in full-throated ease. 10 [ 108 ] 2.
O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, Tasting of Flora and the country green, Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
O for a beaker full of the warm South, Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, And purple-stained mouth; That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, And with thee fade away into the forest dim: 20 3.
Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget What thou among the leaves hast never known, The weariness, the fever, and the fret Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, [ 109 ] Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; Where but to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden-eyed despairs, Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. 30 4.
Away! away! for I will fly to thee, Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, But on the viewless wings of Poesy, Though the dull brain perplexes and retards: Already with thee! tender is the night, And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays; But here there is no light, Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. 40 [ 110 ] 5.
I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet Wherewith the seasonable month endows The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild; White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves; And mid-May's eldest child, The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. 50 6.
Darkling I listen; and, for many a time I have been half in love with easeful Death, Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme, To take into the air my quiet breath; Now more than ever seems it rich to die, [ 111 ] To cease upon the midnight with no pain, While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstasy!
Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain— To thy high requiem become a sod. 60 7.
Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
No hungry generations tread thee down; The voice I hear this passing night was heard In ancient days by emperor and clown: Perhaps the self-same song that found a path Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn; The same that oft-times hath Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. 70 [ 112 ] 8.
Forlorn! the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep In the next valley-glades: Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep? 80 [ 113 ] ODE ON A GRECIAN URN. 1.
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness, Thou foster-child of silence and slow time, Sylvan historian, who canst thus express A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme: What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape Of deities or mortals, or of both, In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
What men or gods are these?
What maidens loth?
What mad pursuit?
What struggle to escape?
What pipes and timbrels?
What wild ecstasy? 10 [ 114 ] 2.
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on; Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd, Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare; Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal—yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! 20 3.
Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu; And, happy melodist, unwearied, For ever piping songs for ever new; [ 115 ] More happy love! more happy, happy love!
For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd, For ever panting, and for ever young; All breathing human passion far above, That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd, A burning forehead, and a parching tongue. 30 4.
Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
To what green altar, O mysterious priest, Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies, And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
What little town by river or sea shore, Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel, Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not a soul to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'er return. 40 [ 116 ] 5.
O Attic shape!
Fair attitude! with brede Of marble men and maidens overwrought, With forest branches and the trodden weed; Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
When old age shall this generation waste, Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st, ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,""—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. 50 [ 117 ] ODE TO PSYCHE.
O Goddess! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear, And pardon that thy secrets should be sung Even into thine own soft-conched ear: Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see The winged Psyche with awaken'd eyes?
I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly, And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise, Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side In deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof 10 Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran A brooklet, scarce espied: [ 118 ] 'Mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed, Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian, They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass; Their arms embraced, and their pinions too; Their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu, As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber, And ready still past kisses to outnumber At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love: 20 The winged boy I knew; But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove?
His Psyche true!
O latest born and loveliest vision far Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy!
Fairer than Phœbe's sapphire-region'd star, Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky; Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none, Nor altar heap'd with flowers; [ 119 ] Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan 30 Upon the midnight hours; No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet From chain-swung censer teeming; No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming.
O brightest! though too late for antique vows, Too, too late for the fond believing lyre, When holy were the haunted forest boughs, Holy the air, the water, and the fire; Yet even in these days so far retir'd 40 From happy pieties, thy lucent fans, Fluttering among the faint Olympians, I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired.
So let me be thy choir, and make a moan Upon the midnight hours; [ 120 ] Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet From swinged censer teeming; Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming.
Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane 50 In some untrodden region of my mind, Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain, Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind: Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep; And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees, The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull'd to sleep; And in the midst of this wide quietness A rosy sanctuary will I dress With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain, 60 With buds, and bells, and stars without a name, [ 121 ] With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign, Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same: And there shall be for thee all soft delight That shadowy thought can win, A bright torch, and a casement ope at night, To let the warm Love in! [ 122 ] FANCY.
Ever let the Fancy roam, Pleasure never is at home: At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth, Like to bubbles when rain pelteth; Then let winged Fancy wander Through the thought still spread beyond her: Open wide the mind's cage-door, She'll dart forth, and cloudward soar.
O sweet Fancy! let her loose; Summer's joys are spoilt by use, 10 And the enjoying of the Spring Fades as does its blossoming; Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too, Blushing through the mist and dew, [ 123 ] Cloys with tasting: What do then?
Sit thee by the ingle, when The sear faggot blazes bright, Spirit of a winter's night; When the soundless earth is muffled, And the caked snow is shuffled 20 From the ploughboy's heavy shoon; When the Night doth meet the Noon In a dark conspiracy To banish Even from her sky.
Sit thee there, and send abroad, With a mind self-overaw'd, Fancy, high-commission'd:—send her!
She has vassals to attend her: She will bring, in spite of frost, Beauties that the earth hath lost; 30 She will bring thee, all together, All delights of summer weather; [ 124 ] All the buds and bells of May, From dewy sward or thorny spray All the heaped Autumn's wealth, With a still, mysterious stealth: She will mix these pleasures up Like three fit wines in a cup, And thou shalt quaff it:—thou shalt hear Distant harvest-carols clear; 40 Rustle of the reaped corn; Sweet birds antheming the morn: And, in the same moment—hark! 'Tis the early April lark, Or the rooks, with busy caw, Foraging for sticks and straw.
Thou shalt, at one glance, behold The daisy and the marigold; White-plum'd lilies, and the first Hedge-grown primrose that hath burst; 50 [ 125 ] Shaded hyacinth, alway Sapphire queen of the mid-May; And every leaf, and every flower Pearled with the self-same shower.
Thou shalt see the field-mouse peep Meagre from its celled sleep; And the snake all winter-thin Cast on sunny bank its skin; Freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see Hatching in the hawthorn-tree, 60 When the hen-bird's wing doth rest Quiet on her mossy nest; Then the hurry and alarm When the bee-hive casts its swarm; Acorns ripe down-pattering, While the autumn breezes sing. [ 126 ] Oh, sweet Fancy! let her loose; Every thing is spoilt by use: Where's the cheek that doth not fade, Too much gaz'd at?
Where's the maid 70 Whose lip mature is ever new?
Where's the eye, however blue, Doth not weary?
Where's the face One would meet in every place?
Where's the voice, however soft, One would hear so very oft?
At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth Like to bubbles when rain pelteth.
Let, then, winged Fancy find Thee a mistress to thy mind: 80 Dulcet-eyed as Ceres' daughter, Ere the God of Torment taught her How to frown and how to chide; With a waist and with a side [ 127 ] White as Hebe's, when her zone Slipt its golden clasp, and down Fell her kirtle to her feet, While she held the goblet sweet, And Jove grew languid.—Break the mesh Of the Fancy's silken leash; 90 Quickly break her prison-string And such joys as these she'll bring.— Let the winged Fancy roam Pleasure never is at home. [ 128 ] ODE.
Bards of Passion and of Mirth, Ye have left your souls on earth!
Have ye souls in heaven too, Double-lived in regions new?
Yes, and those of heaven commune With the spheres of sun and moon; With the noise of fountains wond'rous, And the parle of voices thund'rous; With the whisper of heaven's trees And one another, in soft ease 10 Seated on Elysian lawns Brows'd by none but Dian's fawns Underneath large blue-bells tented, Where the daisies are rose-scented, [ 129 ] And the rose herself has got Perfume which on earth is not; Where the nightingale doth sing Not a senseless, tranced thing, But divine melodious truth; Philosophic numbers smooth; 20 Tales and golden histories Of heaven and its mysteries.
Thus ye live on high, and then On the earth ye live again; And the souls ye left behind you Teach us, here, the way to find you, Where your other souls are joying, Never slumber'd, never cloying.
Here, your earth-born souls still speak To mortals, of their little week; 30 [ 130 ] Of their sorrows and delights; Of their passions and their spites; Of their glory and their shame; What doth strengthen and what maim.
Thus ye teach us, every day, Wisdom, though fled far away.
Bards of Passion and of Mirth, Ye have left your souls on earth!
Ye have souls in heaven too, Double-lived in regions new! 40 [ 131 ] LINES ON THE MERMAID TAVERN.
Souls of Poets dead and gone, What Elysium have ye known, Happy field or mossy cavern, Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?
Have ye tippled drink more fine Than mine host's Canary wine?
Or are fruits of Paradise Sweeter than those dainty pies Of venison?
O generous food!
Drest as though bold Robin Hood 10 Would, with his maid Marian, Sup and bowse from horn and can. [ 132 ] I have heard that on a day Mine host's sign-board flew away, Nobody knew whither, till An astrologer's old quill To a sheepskin gave the story, Said he saw you in your glory, Underneath a new old-sign Sipping beverage divine, 20 And pledging with contented smack The Mermaid in the Zodiac.

TO A FRIEND.,"No! those days are gone away, And their hours are old and gray, And their minutes buried all Under the down-trodden pall Of the leaves of many years: Many times have winter's shears, Frozen North, and chilling East, Sounded tempests to the feast Of the forest's whispering fleeces, Since men knew nor rent nor leases. 10 No, the bugle sounds no more, And the twanging bow no more; [ 134 ] Silent is the ivory shrill Past the heath and up the hill; There is no mid-forest laugh, Where lone Echo gives the half To some wight, amaz'd to hear Jesting, deep in forest drear.
On the fairest time of June You may go, with sun or moon, 20 Or the seven stars to light you, Or the polar ray to right you; But you never may behold Little John, or Robin bold; Never one, of all the clan, Thrumming on an empty can Some old hunting ditty, while He doth his green way beguile To fair hostess Merriment, Down beside the pasture Trent; 30 [ 135 ] For he left the merry tale Messenger for spicy ale.
Gone, the merry morris din; Gone, the song of Gamelyn; Gone, the tough-belted outlaw Idling in the ""grenè shawe;"" All are gone away and past!
And if Robin should be cast Sudden from his turfed grave, And if Marian should have 40 Once again her forest days, She would weep, and he would craze: He would swear, for all his oaks, Fall'n beneath the dockyard strokes, Have rotted on the briny seas; She would weep that her wild bees Sang not to her—strange! that honey Can't be got without hard money! [ 136 ] So it is: yet let us sing, Honour to the old bow-string! 50 Honour to the bugle-horn!
Honour to the woods unshorn!
Honour to the Lincoln green!
Honour to the archer keen!
Honour to tight little John, And the horse he rode upon!
Honour to bold Robin Hood, Sleeping in the underwood!
Honour to maid Marian, And to all the Sherwood-clan! 60 Though their days have hurried by Let us two a burden try. [ 137 ] TO AUTUMN. 1.
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun; Conspiring with him how to load and bless With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run; To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees, And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core; To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells With a sweet kernel; to set budding more, And still more, later flowers for the bees, Until they think warm days will never cease, 10 For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells. [ 138 ] 2.
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind; Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep, Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers: And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep Steady thy laden head across a brook; 20 Or by a cyder-press, with patient look, Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours. 3.
Where are the songs of Spring?
Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,— While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day, And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue; [ 139 ] Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn Among the river sallows, borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies; And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn; 30 Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft; And gathering swallows twitter in the skies. [ 140 ] ODE ON MELANCHOLY. 1.
No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine; Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine; Make not your rosary of yew-berries, Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl A partner in your sorrow's mysteries; For shade to shade will come too drowsily, And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul. 10 [ 141 ] 2.
But when the melancholy fit shall fall Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud, That fosters the droop-headed flowers all, And hides the green hill in an April shroud; Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose, Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave, Or on the wealth of globed peonies; Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows, Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave, And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes. 20 3.
She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die; And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh, Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips: [ 142 ] Ay, in the very temple of Delight Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine, Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine; His soul shall taste the sadness of her might, And be among her cloudy trophies hung. 30 [ 143 ] HYPERION."

Deep in the shady sadness of a vale Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn, Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star, Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone, Still as the silence round about his lair; Forest on forest hung about his head Like cloud on cloud.
No stir of air was there, Not so much life as on a summer's day Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass, But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. 10 [ 146 ] A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more By reason of his fallen divinity Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.
Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went, No further than to where his feet had stray'd, And slept there since.
Upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed; While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth, 20 His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.
It seem'd no force could wake him from his place; But there came one, who with a kindred hand Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low With reverence, though to one who knew it not.
She was a Goddess of the infant world; [ 147 ] By her in stature the tall Amazon Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en Achilles by the hair and bent his neck; Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel. 30 Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx, Pedestal'd haply in a palace court, When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.
But oh! how unlike marble was that face: How beautiful, if sorrow had not made Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.
There was a listening fear in her regard, As if calamity had but begun; As if the vanward clouds of evil days Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear 40 Was with its stored thunder labouring up.
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot Where beats the human heart, as if just there, Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain: [ 148 ] The other upon Saturn's bended neck She laid, and to the level of his ear Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake In solemn tenour and deep organ tone: Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue Would come in these like accents; O how frail 50 To that large utterance of the early Gods! ""Saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old King?
I have no comfort for thee, no not one: I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?' For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God; And ocean too, with all its solemn noise, Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.
Thy thunder, conscious of the new command, 60 Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house; And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands [ 149 ] Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
O aching time!
O moments big as years!
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth, And press it so upon our weary griefs That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
Saturn, sleep on:—O thoughtless, why did I Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes? 70 Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep."" As when, upon a tranced summer-night, Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods, Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a stir, Save from one gradual solitary gust Which comes upon the silence, and dies off, As if the ebbing air had but one wave; So came these words and went; the while in tears [ 150 ] She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground, 80 Just where her falling hair might be outspread A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.
One moon, with alteration slow, had shed Her silver seasons four upon the night, And still these two were postured motionless, Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern; The frozen God still couchant on the earth, And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet: Until at length old Saturn lifted up His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, 90 And all the gloom and sorrow of the place, And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake, As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard Shook horrid with such aspen-malady: ""O tender spouse of gold Hyperion, Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face; Look up, and let me see our doom in it; [ 151 ] Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow, 100 Naked and bare of its great diadem, Peers like the front of Saturn.
Who had power To make me desolate? whence came the strength?
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth, While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?
But it is so; and I am smother'd up, And buried from all godlike exercise Of influence benign on planets pale, Of admonitions to the winds and seas, Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting, 110 And all those acts which Deity supreme Doth ease its heart of love in.—I am gone Away from my own bosom: I have left My strong identity, my real self, Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit Here on this spot of earth.
Search, Thea, search! [ 152 ] Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light; Space region'd with life-air; and barren void; Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.— 120 Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest A certain shape or shadow, making way With wings or chariot fierce to repossess A heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must Be of ripe progress—Saturn must be King.
Yes, there must be a golden victory; There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival Upon the gold clouds metropolitan, Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir 130 Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be Beautiful things made new, for the surprise Of the sky-children; I will give command: Thea!
Thea!
Thea! where is Saturn?"" [ 153 ] This passion lifted him upon his feet, And made his hands to struggle in the air, His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat, His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.
He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep; A little time, and then again he snatch'd 140 Utterance thus.—""But cannot I create?
Cannot I form?
Cannot I fashion forth Another world, another universe, To overbear and crumble this to nought?
Where is another chaos?
Where?""—That word Found way unto Olympus, and made quake The rebel three.—Thea was startled up, And in her bearing was a sort of hope, As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe. ""This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends, 150 O Saturn! come away, and give them heart; [ 154 ] I know the covert, for thence came I hither."" Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went With backward footing through the shade a space: He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed, More sorrow like to this, and such like woe, Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe: 160 The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound, Groan'd for the old allegiance once more, And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;— Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure: [ 155 ] For as among us mortals omens drear Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he— 170 Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech, Or the familiar visiting of one Upon the first toll of his passing-bell, Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp; But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve, Oft made Hyperion ache.
His palace bright Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold, And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks, Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts, Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries; 180 And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings, Unseen before by Gods or wondering men, Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard, Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.
Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths [ 156 ] Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills, Instead of sweets, his ample palate took Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick: And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west, 190 After the full completion of fair day,— For rest divine upon exalted couch And slumber in the arms of melody, He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease With stride colossal, on from hall to hall; While far within each aisle and deep recess, His winged minions in close clusters stood, Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men Who on wide plains gather in panting troops, When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. 200 Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance, Went step for step with Thea through the woods, Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear, Came slope upon the threshold of the west; [ 157 ] Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes, Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies; And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape, In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye, 210 That inlet to severe magnificence Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.
He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath; His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels, And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire, That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours And made their dove-wings tremble.
On he flared, From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault, Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light, And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades, 220 [ 158 ] Until he reach'd the great main cupola; There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot, And from the basements deep to the high towers Jarr'd his own golden region; and before The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd, His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb, To this result: ""O dreams of day and night!
O monstrous forms!
O effigies of pain!
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!
O lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools! 230 Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why Is my eternal essence thus distraught To see and to behold these horrors new?
Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?
Am I to leave this haven of my rest, This cradle of my glory, this soft clime, This calm luxuriance of blissful light, These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes, [ 159 ] Of all my lucent empire?
It is left Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine. 240 The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry, I cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness.
Even here, into my centre of repose, The shady visions come to domineer, Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.— Fall!—No, by Tellus and her briny robes!
Over the fiery frontier of my realms I will advance a terrible right arm Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove, And bid old Saturn take his throne again.""— 250 He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat Held struggle with his throat but came not forth; For as in theatres of crowded men Hubbub increases more they call out ""Hush!"" So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold; [ 160 ] And from the mirror'd level where he stood A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.
At this, through all his bulk an agony Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown, 260 Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd From over-strained might.
Releas'd, he fled To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours Before the dawn in season due should blush, He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals, Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.
The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode Each day from east to west the heavens through, 270 Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds; Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid, But ever and anon the glancing spheres, Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure, [ 161 ] Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep Up to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old, Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers Then living on the earth, with labouring thought Won from the gaze of many centuries: 280 Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone, Their wisdom long since fled.—Two wings this orb Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings, Ever exalted at the God's approach: And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were; While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse, Awaiting for Hyperion's command.
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne 290 And bid the day begin, if but for change.
He might not:—No, though a primeval God: [ 162 ] The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.
Therefore the operations of the dawn Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.
Those silver wings expanded sisterly, Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes, Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent 300 His spirit to the sorrow of the time; And all along a dismal rack of clouds, Upon the boundaries of day and night, He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.
There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice Of Cœlus, from the universal space, Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear. ""O brightest of my children dear, earth-born And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries 310 [ 163 ] All unrevealed even to the powers Which met at thy creating; at whose joys And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft, I, Cœlus, wonder, how they came and whence; And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be, Distinct, and visible; symbols divine, Manifestations of that beauteous life Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space: Of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child!
Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses! 320 There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion Of son against his sire.
I saw him fall, I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is: For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods. [ 164 ] Divine ye were created, and divine In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd, 330 Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled: Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath; Actions of rage and passion; even as I see them, on the mortal world beneath, In men who die.—This is the grief, O Son!
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!
Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable, As thou canst move about, an evident God; And canst oppose to each malignant hour Ethereal presence:—I am but a voice; 340 My life is but the life of winds and tides, No more than winds and tides can I avail:— But thou canst.—Be thou therefore in the van Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb Before the tense string murmur.—To the earth!
For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes. [ 165 ] Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun, And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.""— Ere half this region-whisper had come down, Hyperion arose, and on the stars 350 Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide: And still they were the same bright, patient stars.
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast, Like to a diver in the pearly seas, Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore, And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night. [ 166 ] [ 167 ] BOOK II.
Just at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings Hyperion slid into the rustled air, And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.
It was a den where no insulting light Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse, Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.
Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd 10 [ 168 ] Ever as if just rising from a sleep, Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns; And thus in thousand hugest phantasies Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.
Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon, Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge Stubborn'd with iron.
All were not assembled: Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.
Cœus, and Gyges, and Briareüs, Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion, 20 With many more, the brawniest in assault, Were pent in regions of laborious breath; Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd; Without a motion, save of their big hearts Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse. [ 169 ] Mnemosyne was straying in the world; Far from her moon had Phœbe wandered; 30 And many else were free to roam abroad, But for the main, here found they covert drear.
Scarce images of life, one here, one there, Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor, When the chill rain begins at shut of eve, In dull November, and their chancel vault, The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.
Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave Or word, or look, or action of despair. 40 Creüs was one; his ponderous iron mace Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.
Iäpetus another; in his grasp, A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length [ 170 ] Dead; and because the creature could not spit Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.
Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost, As though in pain; for still upon the flint 50 He ground severe his skull, with open mouth And eyes at horrid working.
Nearest him Asia, born of most enormous Caf, Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs, Though feminine, than any of her sons: More thought than woe was in her dusky face, For she was prophesying of her glory; And in her wide imagination stood Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes, By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles. 60 Even as Hope upon her anchor leans, So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk Shed from the broadest of her elephants.
Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve, [ 171 ] Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else, Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild As grazing ox unworried in the meads; Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth, He meditated, plotted, and even now Was hurling mountains in that second war, 70 Not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.
Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons.
Neighbour'd close Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.
In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight; No shape distinguishable, more than when Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds: 80 And many else whose names may not be told.
For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread, [ 172 ] Who shall delay her flight?
And she must chaunt Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd With damp and slippery footing from a depth More horrid still.
Above a sombre cliff Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew Till on the level height their steps found ease: Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms Upon the precincts of this nest of pain, 90 And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face: There saw she direst strife; the supreme God At war with all the frailty of grief, Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge, Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.
Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head, A disanointing poison: so that Thea, Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass First onwards in, among the fallen tribe. 100 [ 173 ] As with us mortal men, the laden heart Is persecuted more, and fever'd more, When it is nighing to the mournful house Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise; So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst, Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest, But that he met Enceladus's eye, Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once Came like an inspiration; and he shouted, ""Titans, behold your God!"" at which some groan'd; 110 Some started on their feet; some also shouted; Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence; And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil, Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan, Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.
There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise Among immortals when a God gives sign, [ 174 ] With hushing finger, how he means to load His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought, 120 With thunder, and with music, and with pomp: Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines; Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world, No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here, Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom Grew up like organ, that begins anew Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short, Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.
Thus grew it up—""Not in my own sad breast, Which is its own great judge and searcher out, 130 Can I find reason why ye should be thus: Not in the legends of the first of days, Studied from that old spirit-leaved book Which starry Uranus with finger bright Sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;— [ 175 ] And the which book ye know I ever kept For my firm-based footstool:—Ah, infirm!
Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,— 140 At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling One against one, or two, or three, or all Each several one against the other three, As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods Drown both, and press them both against earth's face, Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath Unhinges the poor world;—not in that strife, Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep, Can I find reason why ye should be thus: No, no-where can unriddle, though I search, 150 And pore on Nature's universal scroll Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities, The first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods, Should cower beneath what, in comparison, [ 176 ] Is untremendous might.
Yet ye are here, O'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!
O Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'—Ye groan: Shall I say 'Crouch!'—Ye groan.
What can I then?
O Heaven wide!
O unseen parent dear!
What can I?
Tell me, all ye brethren Gods, 160 How we can war, how engine our great wrath!
O speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear Is all a-hunger'd.
Thou, Oceanus, Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face I see, astonied, that severe content Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!"" So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea, Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove, But cogitation in his watery shades, Arose, with locks not oozy, and began, 170 In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue [ 177 ] Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands. ""O ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung, Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!
Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears, My voice is not a bellows unto ire.
Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop: And in the proof much comfort will I give, If ye will take that comfort in its truth. 180 We fall by course of Nature's law, not force Of thunder, or of Jove.
Great Saturn, thou Hast sifted well the atom-universe; But for this reason, that thou art the King, And only blind from sheer supremacy, One avenue was shaded from thine eyes, Through which I wandered to eternal truth.
And first, as thou wast not the first of powers, So art thou not the last; it cannot be: [ 178 ] Thou art not the beginning nor the end. 190 From chaos and parental darkness came Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil, That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends Was ripening in itself.
The ripe hour came, And with it light, and light, engendering Upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd The whole enormous matter into life.
Upon that very hour, our parentage, The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest: Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race, 200 Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.
Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain; O folly! for to bear all naked truths, And to envisage circumstance, all calm, That is the top of sovereignty.
Mark well!
As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs; [ 179 ] And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth In form and shape compact and beautiful, In will, in action free, companionship, 210 And thousand other signs of purer life; So on our heels a fresh perfection treads, A power more strong in beauty, born of us And fated to excel us, as we pass In glory that old Darkness: nor are we Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule Of shapeless Chaos.
Say, doth the dull soil Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed, And feedeth still, more comely than itself?
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves? 220 Or shall the tree be envious of the dove Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings To wander wherewithal and find its joys?
We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves, [ 180 ] But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower Above us in their beauty, and must reign In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law That first in beauty should be first in might: Yea, by that law, another race may drive 230 Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.
Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas, My dispossessor?
Have ye seen his face?
Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along By noble winged creatures he hath made?
I saw him on the calmed waters scud, With such a glow of beauty in his eyes, That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell To all my empire: farewell sad I took, And hither came, to see how dolorous fate 240 Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best Give consolation in this woe extreme.
Receive the truth, and let it be your balm."" [ 181 ] Whether through poz'd conviction, or disdain, They guarded silence, when Oceanus Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?
But so it was, none answer'd for a space, Save one whom none regarded, Clymene; And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd, With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild, 250 Thus wording timidly among the fierce: ""O Father, I am here the simplest voice, And all my knowledge is that joy is gone, And this thing woe crept in among our hearts, There to remain for ever, as I fear: I would not bode of evil, if I thought So weak a creature could turn off the help Which by just right should come of mighty Gods; Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell Of what I heard, and how it made me weep, 260 And know that we had parted from all hope. [ 182 ] I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore, Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.
Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief; Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth; So that I felt a movement in my heart To chide, and to reproach that solitude With songs of misery, music of our woes; And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell 270 And murmur'd into it, and made melody— O melody no more! for while I sang, And with poor skill let pass into the breeze The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand Just opposite, an island of the sea, There came enchantment with the shifting wind, That did both drown and keep alive my ears.
I threw my shell away upon the sand, And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd [ 183 ] With that new blissful golden melody. 280 A living death was in each gush of sounds, Each family of rapturous hurried notes, That fell, one after one, yet all at once, Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string: And then another, then another strain, Each like a dove leaving its olive perch, With music wing'd instead of silent plumes, To hover round my head, and make me sick Of joy and grief at once.
Grief overcame, And I was stopping up my frantic ears, 290 When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands, A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune, And still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!
The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!' I fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'Apollo!' O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt, [ 184 ] Ye would not call this too indulged tongue Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard."" So far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook 300 That, lingering along a pebbled coast, Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met, And shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath: The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks, Came booming thus, while still upon his arm He lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt. ""Or shall we listen to the over-wise, Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods? 310 Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all That rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent, Not world on world upon these shoulders piled, Could agonize me more than baby-words [ 185 ] In midst of this dethronement horrible.
Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.
Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?
Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?
Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the Waves, Thy scalding in the seas?
What, have I rous'd 320 Your spleens with so few simple words as these?
O joy! for now I see ye are not lost: O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes Wide glaring for revenge!""—As this he said, He lifted up his stature vast, and stood, Still without intermission speaking thus: ""Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn, And purge the ether of our enemies; How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire, And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove, 330 Stifling that puny essence in its tent.
O let him feel the evil he hath done; [ 186 ] For though I scorn Oceanus's lore, Much pain have I for more than loss of realms: The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled; Those days, all innocent of scathing war, When all the fair Existences of heaven Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak:— That was before our brows were taught to frown, Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds; 340 That was before we knew the winged thing, Victory, might be lost, or might be won.
And be ye mindful that Hyperion, Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced— Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!"" All eyes were on Enceladus's face, And they beheld, while still Hyperion's name Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks, A pallid gleam across his features stern: [ 187 ] Not savage, for he saw full many a God 350 Wroth as himself.
He look'd upon them all, And in each face he saw a gleam of light, But splendider in Saturn's, whose hoar locks Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.
In pale and silver silence they remain'd, Till suddenly a splendour, like the morn, Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps, All the sad spaces of oblivion, And every gulf, and every chasm old, 360 And every height, and every sullen depth, Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams: And all the everlasting cataracts, And all the headlong torrents far and near, Mantled before in darkness and huge shade, Now saw the light and made it terrible.
It was Hyperion:—a granite peak [ 188 ] His bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view The misery his brilliance had betray'd To the most hateful seeing of itself. 370 Golden his hair of short Numidian curl, Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk Of Memnon's image at the set of sun To one who travels from the dusking East: Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon's harp He utter'd, while his hands contemplative He press'd together, and in silence stood.
Despondence seiz'd again the fallen Gods At sight of the dejected King of Day, 380 And many hid their faces from the light: But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare, Uprose Iäpetus, and Creüs too, And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode [ 189 ] To where he towered on his eminence.
There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name; Hyperion from the peak loud answered, ""Saturn!"" Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods, In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods 390 Gave from their hollow throats the name of ""Saturn!"" [ 190 ] [ 191 ] BOOK III.
Thus in alternate uproar and sad peace, Amazed were those Titans utterly.
O leave them, Muse!
O leave them to their woes; For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire: A solitary sorrow best befits Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.
Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find Many a fallen old Divinity Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.
Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp, 10 [ 192 ] And not a wind of heaven but will breathe In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute; For lo! 'tis for the Father of all verse.
Flush every thing that hath a vermeil hue, Let the rose glow intense and warm the air, And let the clouds of even and of morn Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills; Let the red wine within the goblet boil, Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp'd shells, On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn 20 Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd.
Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades, Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green, And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech, In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song, And hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade: Apollo is once more the golden theme! [ 193 ] Where was he, when the Giant of the Sun Stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers? 30 Together had he left his mother fair And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower, And in the morning twilight wandered forth Beside the osiers of a rivulet, Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.
The nightingale had ceas'd, and a few stars Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush Began calm-throated.
Throughout all the isle There was no covert, no retired cave Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves, 40 Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.
He listen'd, and he wept, and his bright tears Went trickling down the golden bow he held.
Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood, While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by [ 194 ] With solemn step an awful Goddess came, And there was purport in her looks for him, Which he with eager guess began to read Perplex'd, the while melodiously he said: ""How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea? 50 Or hath that antique mien and robed form Mov'd in these vales invisible till now?
Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone In cool mid-forest.
Surely I have traced The rustle of those ample skirts about These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.
Goddess!
I have beheld those eyes before, And their eternal calm, and all that face, 60 Or I have dream'd.""—""Yes,"" said the supreme shape, ""Thou hast dream'd of me; and awaking up [ 195 ] Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side, Whose strings touch'd by thy fingers, all the vast Unwearied ear of the whole universe Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth Of such new tuneful wonder.
Is't not strange That thou shouldst weep, so gifted?
Tell me, youth, What sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs 70 To one who in this lonely isle hath been The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life, From the young day when first thy infant hand Pluck'd witless the weak flowers, till thine arm Could bend that bow heroic to all times.
Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones For prophecies of thee, and for the sake Of loveliness new born.""—Apollo then, [ 196 ] With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes, 80 Thus answer'd, while his white melodious throat Throbb'd with the syllables.—""Mnemosyne!
Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how; Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest?
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips Would come no mystery?
For me, dark, dark, And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes: I strive to search wherefore I am so sad, Until a melancholy numbs my limbs; And then upon the grass I sit, and moan, 90 Like one who once had wings.—O why should I Feel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air Yields to my step aspirant? why should I Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?
Goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing: Are there not other regions than this isle? [ 197 ] What are the stars?
There is the sun, the sun!
And the most patient brilliance of the moon!
And stars by thousands!
Point me out the way To any one particular beauteous star, 100 And I will flit into it with my lyre, And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss.
I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?
Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity Makes this alarum in the elements, While I here idle listen on the shores In fearless yet in aching ignorance?
O tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp, That waileth every morn and eventide, Tell me why thus I rave, about these groves! 110 Mute thou remainest—Mute! yet I can read A wondrous lesson in thy silent face: Knowledge enormous makes a God of me. [ 198 ] Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions, Majesties, sovran voices, agonies, Creations and destroyings, all at once Pour into the wide hollows of my brain, And deify me, as if some blithe wine Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk, And so become immortal.""—Thus the God, 120 While his enkindled eyes, with level glance Beneath his white soft temples, stedfast kept Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.
Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush All the immortal fairness of his limbs; Most like the struggle at the gate of death; Or liker still to one who should take leave Of pale immortal death, and with a pang As hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse Die into life: so young Apollo anguish'd: 130 [ 199 ] His very hair, his golden tresses famed Kept undulation round his eager neck.
During the pain Mnemosyne upheld Her arms as one who prophesied.—At length Apollo shriek'd;—and lo! from all his limbs Celestial * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE END. [ 200 ] NOTE.

INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.
Lamia , like Endymion , is written in the heroic couplet, but the difference in style is very marked.
The influence of Dryden's narrative-poems (his translations from Boccaccio and Chaucer) is clearly traceable in the metre, style, and construction of the later poem.
Like Dryden, Keats now makes frequent use of the Alexandrine, or 6-foot line, and of the triplet.
He has also restrained the exuberance of his language and gained force, whilst in imaginative power and felicity of diction he surpasses anything of which Dryden was capable.
The flaws in his style are mainly due to carelessness in the rimes and some questionable coining of words.
He also occasionally lapses into the vulgarity and triviality which marred certain of his early poems.
The best he gained from his study of Dryden's Fables , a debt perhaps to Chaucer rather than to Dryden, was a notable advance in constructive power.
In Lamia he shows a very much greater sense of proportion and power of selection than in his earlier work.
There is, as it were, more light and shade.
Thus we find that whenever the occasion demands it his style rises to supreme force and beauty.
The metamorphosis [ 202 ] of the serpent, the entry of Lamia and Lycius into Corinth, the building by Lamia of the Fairy Hall, and her final withering under the eye of Apollonius—these are the most important points in the story, and the passages in which they are described are also the most striking in the poem.
The allegorical meaning of the story seems to be, that it is fatal to attempt to separate the sensuous and emotional life from the life of reason.
Philosophy alone is cold and destructive, but the pleasures of the senses alone are unreal and unsatisfying.
The man who attempts such a divorce between the two parts of his nature will fail miserably as did Lycius, who, unable permanently to exclude reason, was compelled to face the death of his illusions, and could not, himself, survive them.
Of the poem Keats himself says, writing to his brother in September, 1819: 'I have been reading over a part of a short poem I have composed lately, called Lamia , and I am certain there is that sort of fire in it that must take hold of people some way; give them either pleasant or unpleasant sensation—what they want is a sensation of some sort.' But to the greatest of Keats's critics, Charles Lamb, the poem appealed somewhat differently, for he writes, 'More exuberantly rich in imagery and painting [than Isabella ] is the story of Lamia .
It is of as gorgeous stuff as ever romance was composed of,' and, after enumerating the most striking pictures in the poem, he adds, '[these] are all that fairy-land can do for us.' Lamia struck his imagination, but his heart was given to Isabella . [ 203 ] NOTES ON LAMIA.

INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA AND THE EVE OF ST.
AGNES In Lamia and Hyperion , as in Endymion , we find Keats inspired by classic story, though the inspiration in each case came to him through Elizabethan writers.
Here, on the other hand, mediaeval legend is his inspiration; the 'faery broods' have driven 'nymph and satyr from the prosperous woods'.
Akin to the Greeks as he was in spirit, in his instinctive personification of the lovely manifestations of nature, his style and method were really more naturally suited to the portrayal of mediaeval scenes, [ 211 ] where he found the richness and warmth of colour in which his soul delighted.
The story of Isabella he took from Boccaccio, an Italian writer of the fourteenth century, whose Decameron , a collection of one hundred stories, has been a store-house of plots for English writers.
By Boccaccio the tale is very shortly and simply told, being evidently interesting to him mainly for its plot.
Keats was attracted to it not so much by the action as by the passion involved, so that his enlargement of it means little elaboration of incident, but very much more dwelling on the psychological aspect.
That is to say, he does not care so much what happens, as what the personages of the poem think and feel.
Thus we see that the main incident of the story, the murder of Lorenzo, is passed over in a line—'Thus was Lorenzo slain and buried in,' the next line, 'There, in that forest, did his great love cease,' bringing us back at once from the physical reality of the murder to the thought of his love, which is to Keats the central fact of the story.
In the delineation of Isabella, her first tender passion of love, her agony of apprehension giving way to dull despair, her sudden wakening to a brief period of frenzied action, described in stanzas of incomparable dramatic force, and the 'peace' which followed when she Forgot the stars, the moon, the sun, And she forgot the blue above the trees, And she forgot the dells where waters run, And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze; She had no knowledge when the day was done, And the new morn she saw not— culminating in the piteous death 'too lone and incomplete'—in [ 212 ] the delineation of all this Keats shows supreme power and insight.
In the conception, too, of the tragic loneliness of Lorenzo's ghost we feel that nothing could be changed, added, or taken away.
Not quite equally happy are the descriptions of the cruel brothers, and of Lorenzo as the young lover.
There is a tendency to exaggerate both their inhumanity and his gentleness, for purposes of contrast, which weakens where it would give strength.
The Eve of St.
Agnes , founded on a popular mediaeval legend, not being a tragedy like Isabella , cannot be expected to rival it in depth and intensity; but in every other poetic quality it equals, where it does not surpass, the former poem.
To be specially noted is the skilful use which Keats here makes of contrast—between the cruel cold without and the warm love within; the palsied age of the Bedesman and Angela, and the eager youth of Porphyro and Madeline; the noise and revel and the hush of Madeline's bedroom, and, as Mr.
Colvin has pointed out, in the moonlight which, chill and sepulchral when it strikes elsewhere, to Madeline is as a halo of glory, an angelic light.
A mysterious charm is given to the poem by the way in which Keats endows inanimate things with a sort of half-conscious life.
The knights and ladies of stone arouse the bedesman's shuddering sympathy when he thinks of the cold they must be enduring; 'the carven angels' ' star'd ' ' eager-eyed ' from the roof of the chapel, and the scutcheon in Madeline's window ' blush'd with blood of queens and kings'. [ 213 ] Keats's characteristic method of description—the way in which, by his masterly choice of significant detail, he gives us the whole feeling of the situation, is here seen in its perfection.
In stanza 1 each line is a picture and each picture contributes to the whole effect of painful chill.
The silence of the sheep, the old man's breath visible in the frosty air,—these are things which many people would not notice, but it is such little things that make the whole scene real to us.
There is another method of description, quite as beautiful in its way, which Coleridge adopted with magic effect in Christabel .
This is to use the power of suggestion, to say very little, but that little of a kind to awaken the reader's imagination and make him complete the picture.
For example, we are told of Christabel— Her gentle limbs did she undress And lay down in her loveliness.
Compare this with stanza xxvi of The Eve of St.
Agnes .
That Keats was a master of both ways of obtaining a romantic effect is shown by his La Belle Dame Sans Merci , considered by some people his masterpiece, where the rich detail of The Eve of St.
Agnes is replaced by reserve and suggestion.
As the poem was not included in the volume published in 1820, it is given here.
La Belle Dame Sans Merci.
Oh what can ail thee Knight at arms Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has withered from the Lake And no birds sing. [ 214 ] Oh what can ail thee Knight at arms So haggard, and so woe begone?
The Squirrel's granary is full And the harvest's done.
I see a lily on thy brow With anguish moist and fever dew, And on thy cheeks a fading rose Fast withereth too.
I met a Lady in the Meads Full beautiful, a faery's child, Her hair was long, her foot was light And her eyes were wild.
I made a garland for her head, And bracelets too, and fragrant zone, She look'd at me as she did love And made sweet moan.
I set her on my pacing steed, And nothing else saw all day long, For sidelong would she bend and sing A Faery's song.
She found me roots of relish sweet, And honey wild and manna dew, And sure in language strange she said I love thee true.
She took me to her elfin grot, And there she wept and sigh'd full sore, And there I shut her wild, wild eyes With kisses four. [ 215 ] And there she lulled me asleep, And there I dream'd, Ah!
Woe betide!
The latest dream I ever dreamt On the cold hill side.
I saw pale Kings, and Princes too, Pale warriors, death pale were they all; They cried, La belle dame sans merci, Thee hath in thrall.
I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam With horrid warning gaped wide, And I awoke, and found me here On the cold hill's side.
And this is why I sojourn here Alone and palely loitering; Though the sedge is withered from the Lake And no birds sing. . ..
NOTES ON ISABELLA.
Metre.
The ottava rima of the Italians, the natural outcome of Keats's turning to Italy for his story.
This stanza had been used by Chaucer and the Elizabethans, and recently by Hookham Frere in The Monks and the Giants and by Byron in Don Juan .
Compare Keats's use of the form with that of either of his contemporaries, and notice how he avoids the epigrammatic close, telling in satire and mock-heroic, but inappropriate to a serious and romantic poem.

These are the stanzas of which Lamb says, 'there is nothing more awfully simple in diction, more nakedly grand and moving in sentiment, in Dante, in Chaucer, or in Spenser'—and again, after an appreciation of Lamia , whose fairy splendours are 'for younger impressibilities', he reverts to them, saying: [ 222 ] 'To us an ounce of feeling is worth a pound of fancy; and therefore we recur again, with a warmer gratitude, to the story of Isabella and the pot of basil, and those never-cloying stanzas which we have cited, and which we think should disarm criticism, if it be not in its nature cruel; if it would not deny to honey its sweetness, nor to roses redness, nor light to the stars in Heaven; if it would not bay the moon out of the skies, rather than acknowledge she is fair.'— The New Times , July 19, 1820. l. 361 . fresh-thrown mould , a corroboration of her fears.

Keats envies the un-self-conscious simplicity of the old ballad-writers in treating such a theme as this, and bids the reader turn to Boccaccio, whose description of the scene he cannot hope to rival.
Boccaccio writes: 'Nor had she dug long before she found the body of her hapless lover, whereon as yet there was no trace of corruption or decay; and thus she saw without any manner of doubt that her vision was true.
And so, saddest of women, knowing that she might not bewail him there, she would gladly, if she could, have carried away the body and given it more honourable sepulture elsewhere; but as she might not do so, she took a knife, and, as best she could, severed the head from the trunk, and wrapped it in a napkin and laid it in the lap of the maid; and having covered the [ 223 ] rest of the corpse with earth, she left the spot, having been seen by none, and went home.'

NOTES ON THE EVE OF ST.
AGNES.
See Introduction to Isabella and The Eve of St.
Agnes , p. 212 .
St.
Agnes was a martyr of the Christian Church who was beheaded just outside Rome in 304 because she refused to marry a Pagan, holding herself to be a bride of Christ.
She was only 13—so small and slender that the smallest fetters they could find slipped over her little wrists and fell to the ground.
But they stripped, tortured, and killed her.
A week after her death her parents dreamed that they saw her in glory with a white lamb, the sign of purity, beside her.
Hence she is always pictured with lambs (as her name signifies), and to the place of her martyrdom two lambs are yearly taken on the anniversary and blessed.
Then their wool is cut off and woven by the nuns into the archbishop's cloak, or pallium (see l. 70 ). [ 225 ] For the legend connected with the Eve of the Saint's anniversary, to which Keats refers, see st. vi .

The death of these two leaves us with the thought of a young, bright world for the lovers to enjoy; whilst at the same time it completes the contrast, which the first introduction of the old bedesman suggested, between the old, the poor, and the joyless, and the young, the rich, and the happy.
INTRODUCTION TO THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE, ODE ON A GRECIAN URN, ODE ON MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.
These four odes, which were all written in 1819, the first three in the early months of that year, ought to be considered together, since the same strain of thought runs through them all and, taken all together, they seem to sum up Keats's philosophy.
In all of them the poet looks upon life as it is, and the eternal principle of beauty, in the first three seeing them [ 230 ] in sharp contrast; in the last reconciling them, and leaving us content.
The first-written of the four, the Ode to a Nightingale , is the most passionately human and personal of them all.
For Keats wrote it soon after the death of his brother Tom, whom he had loved devotedly and himself nursed to the end.
He was feeling keenly the tragedy of a world 'where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies', and the song of the nightingale, heard in a friend's garden at Hampstead, made him long to escape with it from this world of realities and sorrows to the world of ideal beauty, which it seemed to him somehow to stand for and suggest.
He did not think of the nightingale as an individual bird, but of its song, which had been beautiful for centuries and would continue to be beautiful long after his generation had passed away; and the thought of this undying loveliness he contrasted bitterly with our feverishly sad and short life.
When, by the power of imagination, he had left the world behind him and was absorbed in the vision of beauty roused by the bird's song, he longed for death rather than a return to disillusionment.
So in the Grecian Urn he contrasts unsatisfying human life with art, which is everlastingly beautiful.
The figures on the vase lack one thing only—reality,—whilst on the other hand they are happy in not being subject to trouble, change, or death.
The thought is sad, yet Keats closes this ode triumphantly, not, as in The Nightingale , on a note of disappointment.
The beauty of this Greek sculpture, truly felt, teaches us that beauty at any rate is real and lasting, and that utter belief in beauty is the one thing needful in life. [ 231 ] In the Ode on Melancholy Keats, in a more bitter mood, finds the presence, in a fleeting world, of eternal beauty the source of the deepest melancholy.
To encourage your melancholy mood, he tells us, do not look on the things counted sad, but on the most beautiful, which are only quickly-fading manifestations of the everlasting principle of beauty.
It is then, when a man most deeply loves the beautiful, when he uses his capacities of joy to the utmost, that the full bitterness of the contrast between the real and the ideal comes home to him and crushes him.
If he did not feel so much he would not suffer so much; if he loved beauty less he would care less that he could not hold it long.
But in the ode To Autumn Keats attains to the serenity he has been seeking.
In this unparalleled description of a richly beautiful autumn day he conveys to us all the peace and comfort which his spirit receives.
He does not philosophize upon the spectacle or draw a moral from it, but he shows us how in nature beauty is ever present.
To the momentary regret for spring he replies with praise of the present hour, concluding with an exquisite description of the sounds of autumn—its music, as beautiful as that of spring.
Hitherto he has lamented the insecurity of a man's hold upon the beautiful, though he has never doubted the reality of beauty and the worth of its worship to man.
Now, under the influence of nature, he intuitively knows that beauty once seen and grasped is man's possession for ever.
He is in much the same position that Wordsworth was when he declared that Nature never did betray The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege, [ 232 ] Through all the years of this our life, to lead From joy to joy: for she can so inform The mind that is within us, so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life, Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold Is full of blessings.
This was not the last poem that Keats wrote, but it was the last which he wrote in the fulness of his powers.
We can scarcely help wishing that, beautiful as were some of the productions of his last feverish year of life, this perfect ode, expressing so serene and untroubled a mood, might have been his last word to the world.
NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.
In the early months of 1819 Keats was living with his friend Brown at Hampstead (Wentworth Place).
In April a nightingale built her nest in the garden, and Brown writes: 'Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table to the grass-plot under a plum, where he sat for two or three hours.
When he came into the house I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books.
On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feeling on the song of our nightingale.
The [ 233 ] writing was not well legible, and it was difficult to arrange the stanza on so many scraps.
With his assistance I succeeded, and this was his Ode to a Nightingale .' Page 107 . l. 4 .

INTRODUCTION TO THE ODE TO PSYCHE.
In one of his long journal-letters to his brother George, Keats writes, at the beginning of May, 1819: 'The following poem—the last I have written—is the first and the only one with which I have taken even moderate pains.
I have for the most part dashed off my lines in a hurry.
This I have done leisurely—I think it reads the more richly for it, and will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit.
You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist, who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour, and perhaps never thought of in the old religion—I am more orthodox than to let a heathen goddess be so neglected.' The Ode to Psyche follows.
The story of Psyche may be best told in the words of William Morris in the 'argument' to 'the story of Cupid and Psyche' in his Earthly Paradise : 'Psyche, a king's daughter, by her exceeding beauty caused the people to forget Venus; therefore the goddess would fain have destroyed her: nevertheless she became the bride of Love, yet in an unhappy moment lost him by her own fault, and wandering through the world suffered many evils at the hands of Venus, for whom she must [ 237 ] accomplish fearful tasks.
But the gods and all nature helped her, and in process of time she was re-united to Love, forgiven by Venus, and made immortal by the Father of gods and men.' Psyche is supposed to symbolize the human soul made immortal through love.

INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.
This poem, although so much lighter in spirit, bears a certain relation in thought to Keats's other odes.
In the Nightingale the tragedy of this life made him long to escape, on the wings of imagination, to the ideal world of beauty symbolized by the song of the bird.
Here finding all real things, even the most beautiful, pall upon him, he extols the fancy, which can escape from reality and is not tied by place or season in its search for new joys.
This is, of course, only a passing mood, as the extempore character of the poetry indicates.
We see more of settled conviction in the deeply-meditative Ode to Autumn , where he finds the ideal in the rich and ever-changing real.
This poem is written in the four-accent metre employed by Milton in L'Allegro and Il Penseroso , and we can often detect a similarity of cadence, and a resemblance in the scenes imagined.

INTRODUCTION TO LINES ON THE MERMAID TAVERN.
The Mermaid Tavern was an old inn in Bread Street, Cheapside.
Tradition says that the literary club there was established by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1603.
In any case it was, in Shakespeare's time, frequented by the chief writers of the day, amongst them Ben Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Selden, Carew, Donne, and Shakespeare himself.
Beaumont, in a poetical epistle to Ben Jonson, writes: What things have we seen Done at the Mermaid! heard words that have been So nimble and so full of subtle flame, As if that any one from whence they came Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest, And has resolved to live a fool the rest Of his dull life.

Zodiac.
The zodiac was an imaginary belt across the heavens within which the sun and planets were supposed to move.
It was divided into twelve parts corresponding to the twelve months of the year, according to the position of the moon when full.
Each of these parts had a sign by which it was known, and the sign of the tenth was a fish-tailed goat, to which Keats refers as the Mermaid.
The word zodiac comes from the Greek ζῴδιον , meaning a little animal, since originally all the signs were animals.
INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.
Early in 1818 John Hamilton Reynolds, a friend of Keats, sent him two sonnets which he had written 'On Robin Hood'.
Keats, in his letter of thanks, after giving an appreciation of Reynolds's production, says: 'In return for your Dish of Filberts, I have gathered a few Catkins, I hope they'll look pretty.' Then follow these lines, entitled, 'To J.
H.
R. in answer to his Robin Hood sonnets.' At the end he writes: 'I hope you will like them—they are at least written in the spirit of outlawry.' Robin Hood, the outlaw, was a popular hero of the Middle Ages.
He was a great poacher of deer, brave, chivalrous, generous, full of fun, and absolutely without respect for law and order.
He robbed the rich to give to the poor, and waged ceaseless war against the wealthy prelates of the church.
Indeed, of his endless practical jokes, the majority were played upon sheriffs and bishops.
He lived, with his 'merry men', in Sherwood Forest, where a hollow tree, said to be his 'larder', is still shown. [ 241 ] Innumerable ballads telling of his exploits were composed, the first reference to which is in the second edition of Langland's Piers Plowman , c. 1377.
Many of these ballads still survive, but in all these traditions it is quite impossible to disentangle fact from fiction.

This poem deals with the overthrow of the primaeval order of Gods by Jupiter, son of Saturn the old king.
There are many versions of the fable in Greek mythology, and there are many sources from which it may have come to Keats.
At school he is said to have known the classical dictionary by heart, but his inspiration is more likely to have been due to his later reading of the Elizabethan poets, and their translations of classic story.
One thing is certain, that he did not confine himself to any one authority, nor did he consider it necessary to be circumscribed by authorities at all.
He used, rather than followed, the Greek fable, dealing freely with it and giving it his own interpretation.
The situation when the poem opens is as follows:—Saturn, king of the gods, has been driven from Olympus down into a deep dell, by his son Jupiter, who has seized and used his father's weapon, the thunderbolt.
A similar fate has overtaken nearly all his brethren, who are called by Keats Titans and Giants indiscriminately, though in Greek mythology the two races are quite distinct.
These Titans are the children of Tellus and Coelus, the earth and sky, thus representing, as it were, the first birth of form and personality from formless nature.
Before the separation of earth and sky, Chaos, a confusion of the elements of all things, had reigned supreme.
One only of the Titans, Hyperion the sun-god, still keeps his kingdom, and he is about to be superseded by young Apollo, the god of light and song. [ 245 ] In the second book we hear Oceanus and Clymene his daughter tell how both were defeated not by battle or violence, but by the irresistible beauty of their dispossessors; and from this Oceanus deduces 'the eternal law, that first in beauty should be first in might'.
He recalls the fact that Saturn himself was not the first ruler, but received his kingdom from his parents, the earth and sky, and he prophesies that progress will continue in the overthrow of Jove by a yet brighter and better order.
Enceladus is, however, furious at what he considers a cowardly acceptance of their fate, and urges his brethren to resist.
In Book I we saw Hyperion, though still a god, distressed by portents, and now in Book III we see the rise to divinity of his successor, the young Apollo.
The poem breaks off short at the moment of Apollo's metamorphosis, and how Keats intended to complete it we can never know.
It is certain that he originally meant to write an epic in ten books, and the publisher's remark [245:1] at the beginning of the 1820 volume would lead us to think that he was in the same mind when he wrote the poem.
This statement, however, must be altogether discounted, as Keats, in his copy of the poems, crossed it right out and wrote above, 'I had no part in this; I was ill at the time.' [ 246 ] Moreover, the last sentence (from 'but' to 'proceeding') he bracketed, writing below, 'This is a lie.' This, together with other evidence external and internal, has led Dr. de Sélincourt to the conclusion that Keats had modified his plan and, when he was writing the poem, intended to conclude it in four books.
Of the probable contents of the one-and-half unwritten books Mr. de Sélincourt writes: 'I conceive that Apollo, now conscious of his divinity, would have gone to Olympus, heard from the lips of Jove of his newly-acquired supremacy, and been called upon by the rebel three to secure the kingdom that awaited him.
He would have gone forth to meet Hyperion, who, struck by the power of supreme beauty, would have found resistance impossible.
Critics have inclined to take for granted the supposition that an actual battle was contemplated by Keats, but I do not believe that such was, at least, his final intention.
In the first place, he had the example of Milton, whom he was studying very closely, to warn him of its dangers; in the second, if Hyperion had been meant to fight he would hardly be represented as already, before the battle, shorn of much of his strength; thus making the victory of Apollo depend upon his enemy's unnatural weakness and not upon his own strength.
One may add that a combat would have been completely alien to the whole idea of the poem as Keats conceived it, and as, in fact, it is universally interpreted from the speech of Oceanus in the second book.
The resistance of Enceladus and the Giants, themselves rebels against an order already established, would have been dealt with summarily, and the poem would have closed with a description of the [ 247 ] new age which had been inaugurated by the triumph of the Olympians, and, in particular, of Apollo the god of light and song.' The central idea, then, of the poem is that the new age triumphs over the old by virtue of its acknowledged superiority—that intellectual supremacy makes physical force feel its power and yield.
Dignity and moral conquest lies, for the conquered, in the capacity to recognize the truth and look upon the inevitable undismayed.
Keats broke the poem off because it was too 'Miltonic', and it is easy to see what he meant.
Not only does the treatment of the subject recall that of Paradise Lost , the council of the fallen gods bearing special resemblance to that of the fallen angels in Book II of Milton's epic, but in its style and syntax the influence of Milton is everywhere apparent.
It is to be seen in the restraint and concentration of the language, which is in marked contrast to the wordiness of Keats's early work, as well as in the constant use of classical constructions, [247:1] Miltonic inversions [247:2] and repetitions, [247:3] and in occasional reminiscences of actual lines and phrases in Paradise Lost . [247:4] [ 248 ] In Hyperion we see, too, the influence of the study of Greek sculpture upon Keats's mind and art.
This study had taught him that the highest beauty is not incompatible with definiteness of form and clearness of detail.
To his romantic appreciation of mystery was now added an equal sense of the importance of simplicity, form, and proportion, these being, from its nature, inevitable characteristics of the art of sculpture.
So we see that again and again the figures described in Hyperion are like great statues—clear-cut, massive, and motionless.
Such are the pictures of Saturn and Thea in Book I, and of each of the group of Titans at the opening of Book II.
Striking too is Keats's very Greek identification of the gods with the powers of Nature which they represent.
It is this attitude of mind which has led some people—Shelley and Landor among them—to declare Keats, in spite of his ignorance of the language, the most truly Greek of all English poets.
Very beautiful instances of this are the sunset and sunrise in Book I, when the departure of the sun-god and his return to earth are so described that the pictures we see are of an evening and morning sky, an angry sunset, and a grey and misty dawn.
But neither Miltonic nor Greek is Keats's marvellous treatment of nature as he feels, and makes us feel, the magic of its mystery in such a picture as that of the tall oaks Branch-charmèd by the earnest stars, or of the dismal cirque Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor, [ 249 ] When the chill rain begins at shut of eve, In dull November, and their chancel vault, The heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.
This Keats, and Keats alone, could do; and his achievement is unique in throwing all the glamour of romance over a fragment 'sublime as Aeschylus'.

Filled in, in pencil, in a transcript of Hyperion by Keats's friend Richard Woodhouse— Glory dawn'd, he was a god."
THE PROBLEM,"I like a church; I like a cowl; I love a prophet of the soul; And on my heart monastic aisles Fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles Yet not for all his faith can see Would I that cowlèd churchman be.
Why should the vest on him allure, Which I could not on me endure?
Not from a vain or shallow thought His awful Jove young Phidias brought; Never from lips of cunning fell The thrilling Delphic oracle; Out from the heart of nature rolled The burdens of the Bible old; The litanies of nations came, Like the volcano's tongue of flame, Up from the burning core below,— The canticles of love and woe: The hand that rounded Peter's dome And groined the aisles of Christian Rome Wrought in a sad sincerity; Himself from God he could not free; He builded better than he knew;— The conscious stone to beauty grew.
Know'st thou what wove yon woodbird's nest Of leaves, and feathers from her breast?
Or how the fish outbuilt her shell, Painting with morn each annual cell?
Or how the sacred pine-tree adds To her old leaves new myriads?
Such and so grew these holy piles, Whilst love and terror laid the tiles.
Earth proudly wears the Parthenon, As the best gem upon her zone, And Morning opes with haste her lids To gaze upon the Pyramids; O'er England's abbeys bends the sky, As on its friends, with kindred eye; For out of Thought's interior sphere These wonders rose to upper air; And Nature gladly gave them place, Adopted them into her race, And granted them an equal date With Andes and with Ararat.
These temples grew as grows the grass; Art might obey, but not surpass.
The passive Master lent his hand To the vast soul that o'er him planned; And the same power that reared the shrine Bestrode the tribes that knelt within.
Ever the fiery Pentecost Girds with one flame the countless host, Trances the heart through chanting choirs, And through the priest the mind inspires.
The word unto the prophet spoken Was writ on tables yet unbroken; The word by seers or sibyls told, In groves of oak, or fanes of gold, Still floats upon the morning wind, Still whispers to the willing mind.
One accent of the Holy Ghost The heedless world hath never lost.
I know what say the fathers wise,— The Book itself before me lies, Old Chrysostom, best Augustine, And he who blent both in his line, The younger Golden Lips or mines, Taylor, the Shakspeare of divines.
His words are music in my ear, I see his cowlèd portrait dear; And yet, for all his faith could see, I would not the good bishop be."
TO RHEA,"Thee, dear friend, a brother soothes, Not with flatteries, but truths, Which tarnish not, but purify To light which dims the morning's eye.
I have come from the spring-woods, From the fragrant solitudes;— Listen what the poplar-tree And murmuring waters counselled me.
If with love thy heart has burned; If thy love is unreturned; Hide thy grief within thy breast, Though it tear thee unexpressed; For when love has once departed From the eyes of the false-hearted, And one by one has torn off quite The bandages of purple light; Though thou wert the loveliest Form the soul had ever dressed, Thou shalt seem, in each reply, A vixen to his altered eye; Thy softest pleadings seem too bold, Thy praying lute will seem to scold; Though thou kept the straightest road, Yet thou errest far and broad.
But thou shalt do as do the gods In their cloudless periods; For of this lore be thou sure,— Though thou forget, the gods, secure, Forget never their command, But make the statute of this land.
As they lead, so follow all, Ever have done, ever shall.
Warning to the blind and deaf, 'T is written on the iron leaf, Who drinks of Cupid's nectar cup Loveth downward, and not up; He who loves, of gods or men, Shall not by the same be loved again; His sweetheart's idolatry Falls, in turn, a new degree.
When a god is once beguiled By beauty of a mortal child And by her radiant youth delighted, He is not fooled, but warily knoweth His love shall never be requited.
And thus the wise Immortal doeth,— 'T is his study and delight To bless that creature day and night; From all evils to defend her; In her lap to pour all splendor; To ransack earth for riches rare, And fetch her stars to deck her hair: He mixes music with her thoughts, And saddens her with heavenly doubts: All grace, all good his great heart knows, Profuse in love, the king bestows, Saying, 'Hearken!
Earth, Sea, Air!
This monument of my despair Build I to the All-Good, All-Fair.
Not for a private good, But I, from my beatitude, Albeit scorned as none was scorned, Adorn her as was none adorned.
I make this maiden an ensample To Nature, through her kingdoms ample, Whereby to model newer races, Statelier forms and fairer faces; To carry man to new degrees Of power and of comeliness.
These presents be the hostages Which I pawn for my release.
See to thyself, O Universe!
Thou art better, and not worse.'— And the god, having given all, Is freed forever from his thrall."
THE VISIT,"Askest, 'How long thou shalt stay?' Devastator of the day!
Know, each substance and relation, Thorough nature's operation, Hath its unit, bound and metre; And every new compound Is some product and repeater,— Product of the earlier found.
But the unit of the visit, The encounter of the wise,— Say, what other metre is it Than the meeting of the eyes?
Nature poureth into nature Through the channels of that feature, Riding on the ray of sight, Fleeter far than whirlwinds go, Or for service, or delight, Hearts to hearts their meaning show, Sum their long experience, And import intelligence.
Single look has drained the breast; Single moment years confessed.
The duration of a glance Is the term of convenance, And, though thy rede be church or state, Frugal multiples of that.
Speeding Saturn cannot halt; Linger,—thou shalt rue the fault: If Love his moment overstay, Hatred's swift repulsions play."
URIEL,"It fell in the ancient periods Which the brooding soul surveys, Or ever the wild Time coined itself Into calendar months and days.
This was the lapse of Uriel, Which in Paradise befell.
Once, among the Pleiads walking, Seyd overheard the young gods talking; And the treason, too long pent, To his ears was evident.
The young deities discussed Laws of form, and metre just, Orb, quintessence, and sunbeams, What subsisteth, and what seems.
One, with low tones that decide, And doubt and reverend use defied, With a look that solved the sphere, And stirred the devils everywhere, Gave his sentiment divine Against the being of a line. 'Line in nature is not found; Unit and universe are round; In vain produced, all rays return; Evil will bless, and ice will burn.' As Uriel spoke with piercing eye, A shudder ran around the sky; The stern old war-gods shook their heads, The seraphs frowned from myrtle-beds; Seemed to the holy festival The rash word boded ill to all; The balance-beam of Fate was bent; The bounds of good and ill were rent; Strong Hades could not keep his own, But all slid to confusion.
A sad self-knowledge, withering, fell On the beauty of Uriel; In heaven once eminent, the god Withdrew, that hour, into his cloud; Whether doomed to long gyration In the sea of generation, Or by knowledge grown too bright To hit the nerve of feebler sight.
Straightway, a forgetting wind Stole over the celestial kind, And their lips the secret kept, If in ashes the fire-seed slept.
But now and then, truth-speaking things Shamed the angels' veiling wings; And, shrilling from the solar course, Or from fruit of chemic force, Procession of a soul in matter, Or the speeding change of water, Or out of the good of evil born, Came Uriel's voice of cherub scorn, And a blush tinged the upper sky, And the gods shook, they knew not why."
THE WORLD-SOUL,"Thanks to the morning light, Thanks to the foaming sea, To the uplands of New Hampshire, To the green-haired forest free; Thanks to each man of courage, To the maids of holy mind, To the boy with his games undaunted Who never looks behind.
Cities of proud hotels, Houses of rich and great, Vice nestles in your chambers, Beneath your roofs of slate.
It cannot conquer folly,— Time-and-space-conquering steam,— And the light-outspeeding telegraph Bears nothing on its beam.
The politics are base; The letters do not cheer; And 'tis far in the deeps of history, The voice that speaketh clear.
Trade and the streets ensnare us, Our bodies are weak and worn; We plot and corrupt each other, And we despoil the unborn.
Yet there in the parlor sits Some figure of noble guise,— Our angel, in a stranger's form, Or woman's pleading eyes; Or only a flashing sunbeam In at the window-pane; Or Music pours on mortals Its beautiful disdain.
The inevitable morning Finds them who in cellars be; And be sure the all-loving Nature Will smile in a factory.
Yon ridge of purple landscape, Yon sky between the walls, Hold all the hidden wonders In scanty intervals.
Alas! the Sprite that haunts us Deceives our rash desire; It whispers of the glorious gods, And leaves us in the mire.
We cannot learn the cipher That's writ upon our cell; Stars taunt us by a mystery Which we could never spell.
If but one hero knew it, The world would blush in flame; The sage, till he hit the secret, Would hang his head for shame.
Our brothers have not read it, Not one has found the key; And henceforth we are comforted,— We are but such as they.
Still, still the secret presses; The nearing clouds draw down; The crimson morning flames into The fopperies of the town.
Within, without the idle earth, Stars weave eternal rings; The sun himself shines heartily, And shares the joy he brings.
And what if Trade sow cities Like shells along the shore, And thatch with towns the prairie broad With railways ironed o'er?— They are but sailing foam-bells Along Thought's causing stream, And take their shape and sun-color From him that sends the dream.
For Destiny never swerves Nor yields to men the helm; He shoots his thought, by hidden nerves, Throughout the solid realm.
The patient Daemon sits, With roses and a shroud; He has his way, and deals his gifts,— But ours is not allowed.
He is no churl nor trifler, And his viceroy is none,— Love-without-weakness,— Of Genius sire and son.
And his will is not thwarted; The seeds of land and sea Are the atoms of his body bright, And his behest obey.
He serveth the servant, The brave he loves amain; He kills the cripple and the sick, And straight begins again; For gods delight in gods, And thrust the weak aside; To him who scorns their charities Their arms fly open wide.
When the old world is sterile And the ages are effete, He will from wrecks and sediment The fairer world complete.
He forbids to despair; His cheeks mantle with mirth; And the unimagined good of men Is yeaning at the birth.
Spring still makes spring in the mind When sixty years are told; Love wakes anew this throbbing heart, And we are never old; Over the winter glaciers I see the summer glow, And through the wild-piled snow-drift The warm rosebuds below."
THE SPHINX,"The Sphinx is drowsy, Her wings are furled: Her ear is heavy, She broods on the world. ""Who'll tell me my secret, The ages have kept?— I awaited the seer While they slumbered and slept:— ""The fate of the man-child, The meaning of man; Known fruit of the unknown; Daedalian plan; Out of sleeping a waking, Out of waking a sleep; Life death overtaking; Deep underneath deep? ""Erect as a sunbeam, Upspringeth the palm; The elephant browses, Undaunted and calm; In beautiful motion The thrush plies his wings; Kind leaves of his covert, Your silence he sings. ""The waves, unashamèd, In difference sweet, Play glad with the breezes, Old playfellows meet; The journeying atoms, Primordial wholes, Firmly draw, firmly drive, By their animate poles. ""Sea, earth, air, sound, silence.
Plant, quadruped, bird, By one music enchanted, One deity stirred,— Each the other adorning, Accompany still; Night veileth the morning, The vapor the hill. ""The babe by its mother Lies bathèd in joy; Glide its hours uncounted,— The sun is its toy; Shines the peace of all being, Without cloud, in its eyes; And the sum of the world In soft miniature lies. ""But man crouches and blushes, Absconds and conceals; He creepeth and peepeth, He palters and steals; Infirm, melancholy, Jealous glancing around, An oaf, an accomplice, He poisons the ground. ""Out spoke the great mother, Beholding his fear;— At the sound of her accents Cold shuddered the sphere:— 'Who has drugged my boy's cup?
Who has mixed my boy's bread?
Who, with sadness and madness, Has turned my child's head?'"" I heard a poet answer Aloud and cheerfully, 'Say on, sweet Sphinx! thy dirges Are pleasant songs to me.
Deep love lieth under These pictures of time; They fade in the light of Their meaning sublime. ""The fiend that man harries Is love of the Best; Yawns the pit of the Dragon, Lit by rays from the Blest.
The Lethe of Nature Can't trance him again, Whose soul sees the perfect, Which his eyes seek in vain. ""To vision profounder, Man's spirit must dive; His aye-rolling orb At no goal will arrive; The heavens that now draw him With sweetness untold, Once found,—for new heavens He spurneth the old. ""Pride ruined the angels, Their shame them restores; Lurks the joy that is sweetest In stings of remorse.
Have I a lover Who is noble and free?— I would he were nobler Than to love me. ""Eterne alternation Now follows, now flies; And under pain, pleasure,— Under pleasure, pain lies.
Love works at the centre, Heart-heaving alway; Forth speed the strong pulses To the borders of day. ""Dull Sphinx, Jove keep thy five wits; Thy sight is growing blear; Rue, myrrh and cummin for the Sphinx, Her muddy eyes to clear!"" The old Sphinx bit her thick lip,— Said, ""Who taught thee me to name?
I am thy spirit, yoke-fellow; Of thine eye I am eyebeam. ""Thou art the unanswered question; Couldst see thy proper eye, Alway it asketh, asketh; And each answer is a lie.
So take thy quest through nature, It through thousand natures ply; Ask on, thou clothed eternity; Time is the false reply."" Uprose the merry Sphinx, And crouched no more in stone; She melted into purple cloud, She silvered in the moon; She spired into a yellow flame; She flowered in blossoms red; She flowed into a foaming wave: She stood Monadnoc's head.
Thorough a thousand voices Spoke the universal dame; ""Who telleth one of my meanings Is master of all I am."""
ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"I, Alphonso, live and learn, Seeing Nature go astern.
Things deteriorate in kind; Lemons run to leaves and rind; Meagre crop of figs and limes; Shorter days and harder times.
Flowering April cools and dies In the insufficient skies.
Imps, at high midsummer, blot Half the sun's disk with a spot; 'Twill not now avail to tan Orange cheek or skin of man.
Roses bleach, the goats are dry, Lisbon quakes, the people cry.
Yon pale, scrawny fisher fools, Gaunt as bitterns in the pools, Are no brothers of my blood;— They discredit Adamhood.
Eyes of gods! ye must have seen, O'er your ramparts as ye lean, The general debility; Of genius the sterility; Mighty projects countermanded; Rash ambition, brokenhanded; Puny man and scentless rose Tormenting Pan to double the dose.
Rebuild or ruin: either fill Of vital force the wasted rill, Or tumble all again in heap To weltering Chaos and to sleep.
Say, Seigniors, are the old Niles dry, Which fed the veins of earth and sky, That mortals miss the loyal heats, Which drove them erst to social feats; Now, to a savage selfness grown, Think nature barely serves for one; With science poorly mask their hurt; And vex the gods with question pert, Immensely curious whether you Still are rulers, or Mildew?
Masters, I'm in pain with you; Masters, I'll be plain with you; In my palace of Castile, I, a king, for kings can feel.
There my thoughts the matter roll, And solve and oft resolve the whole.
And, for I'm styled Alphonse the Wise, Ye shall not fail for sound advice.
Before ye want a drop of rain, Hear the sentiment of Spain.
You have tried famine: no more try it; Ply us now with a full diet; Teach your pupils now with plenty, For one sun supply us twenty.
I have thought it thoroughly over,— State of hermit, state of lover; We must have society, We cannot spare variety.
Hear you, then, celestial fellows!
Fits not to be overzealous; Steads not to work on the clean jump, Nor wine nor brains perpetual pump.
Men and gods are too extense; Could you slacken and condense?
Your rank overgrowths reduce Till your kinds abound with juice?
Earth, crowded, cries, 'Too many men!' My counsel is, kill nine in ten, And bestow the shares of all On the remnant decimal.
Add their nine lives to this cat; Stuff their nine brains in one hat; Make his frame and forces square With the labors he must dare; Thatch his flesh, and even his years With the marble which he rears.
There, growing slowly old at ease No faster than his planted trees, He may, by warrant of his age, In schemes of broader scope engage.
So shall ye have a man of the sphere Fit to grace the solar year."
MITHRIDATES,"I cannot spare water or wine, Tobacco-leaf, or poppy, or rose; From the earth-poles to the Line, All between that works or grows, Every thing is kin of mine.
Give me agates for my meat; Give me cantharids to eat; From air and ocean bring me foods, From all zones and altitudes;— From all natures, sharp and slimy, Salt and basalt, wild and tame: Tree and lichen, ape, sea-lion, Bird, and reptile, be my game.
Ivy for my fillet band; Blinding dog-wood in my hand; Hemlock for my sherbet cull me, And the prussic juice to lull me; Swing me in the upas boughs, Vampyre-fanned, when I carouse.
Too long shut in strait and few, Thinly dieted on dew, I will use the world, and sift it, To a thousand humors shift it, As you spin a cherry.
O doleful ghosts, and goblins merry!
O all you virtues, methods, mights, Means, appliances, delights, Reputed wrongs and braggart rights, Smug routine, and things allowed, Minorities, things under cloud!
Hither! take me, use me, fill me, Vein and artery, though ye kill me!"
TO J.W.,"Set not thy foot on graves; Hear what wine and roses say; The mountain chase, the summer waves, The crowded town, thy feet may well delay.
Set not thy foot on graves; Nor seek to unwind the shroud Which charitable Time And Nature have allowed To wrap the errors of a sage sublime.
Set not thy foot on graves; Care not to strip the dead Of his sad ornament, His myrrh, and wine, and rings, His sheet of lead, And trophies buried: Go, get them where he earned them when alive; As resolutely dig or dive.
Life is too short to waste In critic peep or cynic bark, Quarrel or reprimand: 'T will soon be dark; Up! mind thine own aim, and God speed the mark!"
DESTINY,"That you are fair or wise is vain, Or strong, or rich, or generous; You must add the untaught strain That sheds beauty on the rose.
There's a melody born of melody, Which melts the world into a sea.
Toil could never compass it; Art its height could never hit; It came never out of wit; But a music music-born Well may Jove and Juno scorn.
Thy beauty, if it lack the fire Which drives me mad with sweet desire, What boots it?
What the soldier's mail, Unless he conquer and prevail?
What all the goods thy pride which lift, If thou pine for another's gift?
Alas! that one is born in blight, Victim of perpetual slight: When thou lookest on his face, Thy heart saith, 'Brother, go thy ways!
None shall ask thee what thou doest, Or care a rush for what thou knowest, Or listen when thou repliest, Or remember where thou liest, Or how thy supper is sodden;' And another is born To make the sun forgotten.
Surely he carries a talisman Under his tongue; Broad his shoulders are and strong; And his eye is scornful, Threatening and young.
I hold it of little matter Whether your jewel be of pure water, A rose diamond or a white, But whether it dazzle me with light.
I care not how you are dressed, In coarsest weeds or in the best; Nor whether your name is base or brave: Nor for the fashion of your behavior; But whether you charm me, Bid my bread feed and my fire warm me And dress up Nature in your favor.
One thing is forever good; That one thing is Success,— Dear to the Eumenides, And to all the heavenly brood.
Who bides at home, nor looks abroad, Carries the eagles, and masters the sword."
GUY,"Mortal mixed of middle clay, Attempered to the night and day, Interchangeable with things, Needs no amulets nor rings.
Guy possessed the talisman That all things from him began; And as, of old, Polycrates Chained the sunshine and the breeze, So did Guy betimes discover Fortune was his guard and lover; In strange junctures, felt, with awe, His own symmetry with law; That no mixture could withstand The virtue of his lucky hand.
He gold or jewel could not lose, Nor not receive his ample dues.
Fearless Guy had never foes, He did their weapons decompose.
Aimed at him, the blushing blade Healed as fast the wounds it made.
If on the foeman fell his gaze, Him it would straightway blind or craze, In the street, if he turned round, His eye the eye 't was seeking found.
It seemed his Genius discreet Worked on the Maker's own receipt, And made each tide and element Stewards of stipend and of rent; So that the common waters fell As costly wine into his well.
He had so sped his wise affairs That he caught Nature in his snares.
Early or late, the falling rain Arrived in time to swell his grain; Stream could not so perversely wind But corn of Guy's was there to grind: The siroc found it on its way, To speed his sails, to dry his hay; And the world's sun seemed to rise To drudge all day for Guy the wise.
In his rich nurseries, timely skill Strong crab with nobler blood did fill; The zephyr in his garden rolled From plum-trees vegetable gold; And all the hours of the year With their own harvest honored were.
There was no frost but welcome came, Nor freshet, nor midsummer flame.
Belonged to wind and world the toil And venture, and to Guy the oil."
HAMATREYA,"Bulkeley, Hunt, Willard, Hosmer, Meriam, Flint, Possessed the land which rendered to their toil Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax, apples, wool and wood.
Each of these landlords walked amidst his farm, Saying, ''Tis mine, my children's and my name's.
How sweet the west wind sounds in my own trees!
How graceful climb those shadows on my hill!
I fancy these pure waters and the flags Know me, as does my dog: we sympathize; And, I affirm, my actions smack of the soil.' Where are these men?
Asleep beneath their grounds: And strangers, fond as they, their furrows plough.
Earth laughs in flowers, to see her boastful boys Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs; Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet Clear of the grave.
They added ridge to valley, brook to pond, And sighed for all that bounded their domain; 'This suits me for a pasture; that's my park; We must have clay, lime, gravel, granite-ledge, And misty lowland, where to go for peat.
The land is well,—lies fairly to the south. 'Tis good, when you have crossed the sea and back, To find the sitfast acres where you left them.' Ah! the hot owner sees not Death, who adds Him to his land, a lump of mould the more.
Hear what the Earth says:—"
       EARTH-SONG,"'Mine and yours; Mine, not yours.
Earth endures; Stars abide— Shine down in the old sea; Old are the shores; But where are old men?
I who have seen much, Such have I never seen. 'The lawyer's deed Ran sure, In tail, To them, and to their heirs Who shall succeed, Without fail, Forevermore. 'Here is the land, Shaggy with wood, With its old valley, Mound and flood.
But the heritors?— Fled like the flood's foam.
The lawyer, and the laws, And the kingdom, Clean swept herefrom. 'They called me theirs, Who so controlled me; Yet every one Wished to stay, and is gone, How am I theirs, If they cannot hold me, But I hold them?' When I heard the Earth-song I was no longer brave; My avarice cooled Like lust in the chill of the grave."
"     ON BEING ASKED, WHENCE IS THE FLOWER?","In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes, I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods, Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook, To please the desert and the sluggish brook.
The purple petals, fallen in the pool, Made the black water with their beauty gay; Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool.
And court the flower that cheapens his array.
Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why This charm is wasted on the earth and sky, Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing, Then Beauty is its own excuse for being: Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!
I never thought to ask, I never knew: But, in my simple ignorance, suppose The self-same Power that brought me there brought you."
THE HUMBLE-BEE,"Burly, dozing humble-bee, Where thou art is clime for me.
Let them sail for Porto Rique, Far-off heats through seas to seek; I will follow thee alone, Thou animated torrid-zone!
Zigzag steerer, desert cheerer, Let me chase thy waving lines; Keep me nearer, me thy hearer, Singing over shrubs and vines.
Insect lover of the sun, Joy of thy dominion!
Sailor of the atmosphere; Swimmer through the waves of air; Voyager of light and noon; Epicurean of June; Wait, I prithee, till I come Within earshot of thy hum,— All without is martyrdom.
When the south wind, in May days, With a net of shining haze Silvers the horizon wall, And with softness touching all, Tints the human countenance With a color of romance, And infusing subtle heats, Turns the sod to violets, Thou, in sunny solitudes, Rover of the underwoods, The green silence dost displace With thy mellow, breezy bass.
Hot midsummer's petted crone, Sweet to me thy drowsy tone Tells of countless sunny hours, Long days, and solid banks of flowers; Of gulfs of sweetness without bound In Indian wildernesses found; Of Syrian peace, immortal leisure, Firmest cheer, and bird-like pleasure.
Aught unsavory or unclean Hath my insect never seen; But violets and bilberry bells, Maple-sap and daffodels, Grass with green flag half-mast high, Succory to match the sky, Columbine with horn of honey, Scented fern, and agrimony, Clover, catchfly, adder's-tongue And brier-roses, dwelt among; All beside was unknown waste, All was picture as he passed.
Wiser far than human seer, Yellow-breeched philosopher!
Seeing only what is fair, Sipping only what is sweet, Thou dost mock at fate and care, Leave the chaff, and take the wheat.
When the fierce northwestern blast Cools sea and land so far and fast, Thou already slumberest deep; Woe and want thou canst outsleep; Want and woe, which torture us, Thy sleep makes ridiculous."
BERRYING,"'May be true what I had heard,— Earth's a howling wilderness, Truculent with fraud and force,' Said I, strolling through the pastures, And along the river-side.
Caught among the blackberry vines, Feeding on the Ethiops sweet, Pleasant fancies overtook me.
I said, 'What influence me preferred, Elect, to dreams thus beautiful?' The vines replied, 'And didst thou deem No wisdom from our berries went?'"
THE SNOW-STORM,"Announced by all the trumpets of the sky, Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields, Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven, And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.
The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed In a tumultuous privacy of storm.
Come see the north wind's masonry.
Out of an unseen quarry Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer Curves his white bastions with projected roof Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he For number or proportion.
Mockingly, On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths; A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn; Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall, Maugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gate A tapering turret overtops the work.
And when his hours are numbered, and the world Is all his own, retiring, as he were not, Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone, Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work, The frolic architecture of the snow."
WOODNOTES I,"1 When the pine tosses its cones To the song of its waterfall tones, Who speeds to the woodland walks?
To birds and trees who talks?
Caesar of his leafy Rome, There the poet is at home.
He goes to the river-side,— Not hook nor line hath he; He stands in the meadows wide,— Nor gun nor scythe to see.
Sure some god his eye enchants: What he knows nobody wants.
In the wood he travels glad, Without better fortune had, Melancholy without bad.
Knowledge this man prizes best Seems fantastic to the rest: Pondering shadows, colors, clouds, Grass-buds and caterpillar-shrouds, Boughs on which the wild bees settle, Tints that spot the violet's petal, Why Nature loves the number five, And why the star-form she repeats: Lover of all things alive, Wonderer at all he meets, Wonderer chiefly at himself, Who can tell him what he is?
Or how meet in human elf Coming and past eternities? 2 And such I knew, a forest seer, A minstrel of the natural year, Foreteller of the vernal ides, Wise harbinger of spheres and tides, A lover true, who knew by heart Each joy the mountain dales impart; It seemed that Nature could not raise A plant in any secret place, In quaking bog, on snowy hill, Beneath the grass that shades the rill, Under the snow, between the rocks, In damp fields known to bird and fox.
But he would come in the very hour It opened in its virgin bower, As if a sunbeam showed the place, And tell its long-descended race.
It seemed as if the breezes brought him, It seemed as if the sparrows taught him; As if by secret sight he knew Where, in far fields, the orchis grew.
Many haps fall in the field Seldom seen by wishful eyes, But all her shows did Nature yield, To please and win this pilgrim wise.
He saw the partridge drum in the woods; He heard the woodcock's evening hymn; He found the tawny thrushes' broods; And the shy hawk did wait for him; What others did at distance hear, And guessed within the thicket's gloom, Was shown to this philosopher, And at his bidding seemed to come. 3 In unploughed Maine he sought the lumberers' gang Where from a hundred lakes young rivers sprang; He trode the unplanted forest floor, whereon The all-seeing sun for ages hath not shone; Where feeds the moose, and walks the surly bear, And up the tall mast runs the woodpecker.
He saw beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds, The slight Linnaea hang its twin-born heads, And blessed the monument of the man of flowers, Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers.
He heard, when in the grove, at intervals, With sudden roar the aged pine-tree falls,— One crash, the death-hymn of the perfect tree, Declares the close of its green century.
Low lies the plant to whose creation went Sweet influence from every element; Whose living towers the years conspired to build, Whose giddy top the morning loved to gild.
Through these green tents, by eldest Nature dressed, He roamed, content alike with man and beast.
Where darkness found him he lay glad at night; There the red morning touched him with its light.
Three moons his great heart him a hermit made, So long he roved at will the boundless shade.
The timid it concerns to ask their way, And fear what foe in caves and swamps can stray, To make no step until the event is known, And ills to come as evils past bemoan.
Not so the wise; no coward watch he keeps To spy what danger on his pathway creeps; Go where he will, the wise man is at home, His hearth the earth,—his hall the azure dome; Where his clear spirit leads him, there's his road By God's own light illumined and foreshowed. 4 'T was one of the charmèd days When the genius of God doth flow; The wind may alter twenty ways, A tempest cannot blow; It may blow north, it still is warm; Or south, it still is clear; Or east, it smells like a clover-farm; Or west, no thunder fear.
The musing peasant, lowly great, Beside the forest water sate; The rope-like pine-roots crosswise grown Composed the network of his throne; The wide lake, edged with sand and grass, Was burnished to a floor of glass, Painted with shadows green and proud Of the tree and of the cloud.
He was the heart of all the scene; On him the sun looked more serene; To hill and cloud his face was known,— It seemed the likeness of their own; They knew by secret sympathy The public child of earth and sky. 'You ask,' he said, 'what guide Me through trackless thickets led, Through thick-stemmed woodlands rough and wide.
I found the water's bed.
The watercourses were my guide; I travelled grateful by their side, Or through their channel dry; They led me through the thicket damp, Through brake and fern, the beavers' camp, Through beds of granite cut my road, And their resistless friendship showed.
The falling waters led me, The foodful waters fed me, And brought me to the lowest land, Unerring to the ocean sand.
The moss upon the forest bark Was pole-star when the night was dark; The purple berries in the wood Supplied me necessary food; For Nature ever faithful is To such as trust her faithfulness.
When the forest shall mislead me, When the night and morning lie, When sea and land refuse to feed me, 'T will be time enough to die; Then will yet my mother yield A pillow in her greenest field, Nor the June flowers scorn to cover The clay of their departed lover.'"
WOODNOTES II,"As sunbeams stream through liberal space And nothing jostle or displace, So waved the pine-tree through my thought And fanned the dreams it never brought. 'Whether is better, the gift or the donor?
Come to me,' Quoth the pine-tree, 'I am the giver of honor.
My garden is the cloven rock, And my manure the snow; And drifting sand-heaps feed my stock, In summer's scorching glow.
He is great who can live by me: The rough and bearded forester Is better than the lord; God fills the script and canister, Sin piles the loaded board.
The lord is the peasant that was, The peasant the lord that shall be; The lord is hay, the peasant grass, One dry, and one the living tree.
Who liveth by the ragged pine Foundeth a heroic line; Who liveth in the palace hall Waneth fast and spendeth all.
He goes to my savage haunts, With his chariot and his care; My twilight realm he disenchants, And finds his prison there. 'What prizes the town and the tower?
Only what the pine-tree yields; Sinew that subdued the fields; The wild-eyed boy, who in the woods Chants his hymn to hills and floods, Whom the city's poisoning spleen Made not pale, or fat, or lean; Whom the rain and the wind purgeth, Whom the dawn and the day-star urgeth, In whose cheek the rose-leaf blusheth, In whose feet the lion rusheth, Iron arms, and iron mould, That know not fear, fatigue, or cold.
I give my rafters to his boat, My billets to his boiler's throat, And I will swim the ancient sea To float my child to victory, And grant to dwellers with the pine Dominion o'er the palm and vine.
Who leaves the pine-tree, leaves his friend, Unnerves his strength, invites his end.
Cut a bough from my parent stem, And dip it in thy porcelain vase; A little while each russet gem Will swell and rise with wonted grace; But when it seeks enlarged supplies, The orphan of the forest dies.
Whoso walks in solitude And inhabiteth the wood, Choosing light, wave, rock and bird, Before the money-loving herd, Into that forester shall pass, From these companions, power and grace.
Clean shall he be, without, within, From the old adhering sin, All ill dissolving in the light Of his triumphant piercing sight: Not vain, sour, nor frivolous; Not mad, athirst, nor garrulous; Grave, chaste, contented, though retired, And of all other men desired.
On him the light of star and moon Shall fall with purer radiance down; All constellations of the sky Shed their virtue through his eye.
Him Nature giveth for defence His formidable innocence; The mounting sap, the shells, the sea, All spheres, all stones, his helpers be; He shall meet the speeding year, Without wailing, without fear; He shall be happy in his love, Like to like shall joyful prove; He shall be happy whilst he wooes, Muse-born, a daughter of the Muse.
But if with gold she bind her hair, And deck her breast with diamond, Take off thine eyes, thy heart forbear, Though thou lie alone on the ground. 'Heed the old oracles, Ponder my spells; Song wakes in my pinnacles When the wind swells.
Soundeth the prophetic wind, The shadows shake on the rock behind, And the countless leaves of the pine are strings Tuned to the lay the wood-god sings.
Hearken!
Hearken!
If thou wouldst know the mystic song Chanted when the sphere was young.
Aloft, abroad, the paean swells; O wise man! hear'st thou half it tells?
O wise man! hear'st thou the least part? 'Tis the chronicle of art.
To the open ear it sings Sweet the genesis of things, Of tendency through endless ages, Of star-dust, and star-pilgrimages, Of rounded worlds, of space and time, Of the old flood's subsiding slime, Of chemic matter, force and form, Of poles and powers, cold, wet, and warm: The rushing metamorphosis Dissolving all that fixture is, Melts things that be to things that seem, And solid nature to a dream.
O, listen to the undersong, The ever old, the ever young; And, far within those cadent pauses, The chorus of the ancient Causes!
Delights the dreadful Destiny To fling his voice into the tree, And shock thy weak ear with a note Breathed from the everlasting throat.
In music he repeats the pang Whence the fair flock of Nature sprang.
O mortal! thy ears are stones; These echoes are laden with tones Which only the pure can hear; Thou canst not catch what they recite Of Fate and Will, of Want and Right, Of man to come, of human life, Of Death and Fortune, Growth and Strife.' Once again the pine-tree sung:— 'Speak not thy speech my boughs among: Put off thy years, wash in the breeze; My hours are peaceful centuries.
Talk no more with feeble tongue; No more the fool of space and time, Come weave with mine a nobler rhyme.
Only thy Americans Can read thy line, can meet thy glance, But the runes that I rehearse Understands the universe; The least breath my boughs which tossed Brings again the Pentecost; To every soul resounding clear In a voice of solemn cheer,— ""Am I not thine?
Are not these thine?"" And they reply, ""Forever mine!"" My branches speak Italian, English, German, Basque, Castilian, Mountain speech to Highlanders, Ocean tongues to islanders, To Fin and Lap and swart Malay, To each his bosom-secret say. 'Come learn with me the fatal song Which knits the world in music strong, Come lift thine eyes to lofty rhymes, Of things with things, of times with times, Primal chimes of sun and shade, Of sound and echo, man and maid, The land reflected in the flood, Body with shadow still pursued.
For Nature beats in perfect tune, And rounds with rhyme her every rune, Whether she work in land or sea, Or hide underground her alchemy.
Thou canst not wave thy staff in air, Or dip thy paddle in the lake, But it carves the bow of beauty there, And the ripples in rhymes the oar forsake.
The wood is wiser far than thou; The wood and wave each other know Not unrelated, unaffied, But to each thought and thing allied, Is perfect Nature's every part, Rooted in the mighty Heart, But thou, poor child! unbound, unrhymed, Whence camest thou, misplaced, mistimed, Whence, O thou orphan and defrauded?
Is thy land peeled, thy realm marauded?
Who thee divorced, deceived and left?
Thee of thy faith who hath bereft, And torn the ensigns from thy brow, And sunk the immortal eye so low?
Thy cheek too white, thy form too slender, Thy gait too slow, thy habits tender For royal man;—they thee confess An exile from the wilderness,— The hills where health with health agrees, And the wise soul expels disease.
Hark! in thy ear I will tell the sign By which thy hurt thou may'st divine.
When thou shalt climb the mountain cliff, Or see the wide shore from thy skiff, To thee the horizon shall express But emptiness on emptiness; There lives no man of Nature's worth In the circle of the earth; And to thine eye the vast skies fall, Dire and satirical, On clucking hens and prating fools, On thieves, on drudges and on dolls.
And thou shalt say to the Most High, ""Godhead! all this astronomy, And fate and practice and invention, Strong art and beautiful pretension, This radiant pomp of sun and star, Throes that were, and worlds that are, Behold! were in vain and in vain;— It cannot be,—I will look again.
Surely now will the curtain rise, And earth's fit tenant me surprise;— But the curtain doth not rise, And Nature has miscarried wholly Into failure, into folly."" 'Alas! thine is the bankruptcy, Blessed Nature so to see.
Come, lay thee in my soothing shade, And heal the hurts which sin has made.
I see thee in the crowd alone; I will be thy companion.
Quit thy friends as the dead in doom, And build to them a final tomb; Let the starred shade that nightly falls Still celebrate their funerals, And the bell of beetle and of bee Knell their melodious memory.
Behind thee leave thy merchandise, Thy churches and thy charities; And leave thy peacock wit behind; Enough for thee the primal mind That flows in streams, that breathes in wind: Leave all thy pedant lore apart; God hid the whole world in thy heart.
Love shuns the sage, the child it crowns, Gives all to them who all renounce.
The rain comes when the wind calls; The river knows the way to the sea; Without a pilot it runs and falls, Blessing all lands with its charity; The sea tosses and foams to find Its way up to the cloud and wind; The shadow sits close to the flying ball; The date fails not on the palm-tree tall; And thou,—go burn thy wormy pages,— Shalt outsee seers, and outwit sages.
Oft didst thou thread the woods in vain To find what bird had piped the strain:— Seek not, and the little eremite Flies gayly forth and sings in sight. 'Hearken once more!
I will tell thee the mundane lore.
Older am I than thy numbers wot, Change I may, but I pass not.
Hitherto all things fast abide, And anchored in the tempest ride.
Trenchant time behoves to hurry All to yean and all to bury: All the forms are fugitive, But the substances survive.
Ever fresh the broad creation, A divine improvisation, From the heart of God proceeds, A single will, a million deeds.
Once slept the world an egg of stone, And pulse, and sound, and light was none; And God said, ""Throb!"" and there was motion And the vast mass became vast ocean.
Onward and on, the eternal Pan, Who layeth the world's incessant plan, Halteth never in one shape, But forever doth escape, Like wave or flame, into new forms Of gem, and air, of plants, and worms.
I, that to-day am a pine, Yesterday was a bundle of grass.
He is free and libertine, Pouring of his power the wine To every age, to every race; Unto every race and age He emptieth the beverage; Unto each, and unto all, Maker and original.
The world is the ring of his spells, And the play of his miracles.
As he giveth to all to drink, Thus or thus they are and think.
With one drop sheds form and feature; With the next a special nature; The third adds heat's indulgent spark; The fourth gives light which eats the dark; Into the fifth himself he flings, And conscious Law is King of kings.
As the bee through the garden ranges, From world to world the godhead changes; As the sheep go feeding in the waste, From form to form He maketh haste; This vault which glows immense with light Is the inn where he lodges for a night.
What recks such Traveller if the bowers Which bloom and fade like meadow flowers A bunch of fragrant lilies be, Or the stars of eternity?
Alike to him the better, the worse,— The glowing angel, the outcast corse.
Thou metest him by centuries, And lo! he passes like the breeze; Thou seek'st in globe and galaxy, He hides in pure transparency; Thou askest in fountains and in fires, He is the essence that inquires.
He is the axis of the star; He is the sparkle of the spar; He is the heart of every creature; He is the meaning of each feature; And his mind is the sky.
Than all it holds more deep, more high.'"
MONADNOC,"Thousand minstrels woke within me, 'Our music's in the hills;'— Gayest pictures rose to win me, Leopard-colored rills. 'Up!—If thou knew'st who calls To twilight parks of beech and pine, High over the river intervals, Above the ploughman's highest line, Over the owner's farthest walls!
Up! where the airy citadel O'erlooks the surging landscape's swell!
Let not unto the stones the Day Her lily and rose, her sea and land display.
Read the celestial sign!
Lo! the south answers to the north; Bookworm, break this sloth urbane; A greater spirit bids thee forth Than the gray dreams which thee detain.
Mark how the climbing Oreads Beckon thee to their arcades; Youth, for a moment free as they, Teach thy feet to feel the ground, Ere yet arrives the wintry day When Time thy feet has bound.
Take the bounty of thy birth, Taste the lordship of the earth.' I heard, and I obeyed,— Assured that he who made the claim, Well known, but loving not a name, Was not to be gainsaid.
Ere yet the summoning voice was still, I turned to Cheshire's haughty hill.
From the fixed cone the cloud-rack flowed Like ample banner flung abroad To all the dwellers in the plains Round about, a hundred miles, With salutation to the sea and to the bordering isles.
In his own loom's garment dressed, By his proper bounty blessed, Fast abides this constant giver, Pouring many a cheerful river; To far eyes, an aerial isle Unploughed, which finer spirits pile, Which morn and crimson evening paint For bard, for lover and for saint; An eyemark and the country's core, Inspirer, prophet evermore; Pillar which God aloft had set So that men might it not forget; It should be their life's ornament, And mix itself with each event; Gauge and calendar and dial, Weatherglass and chemic phial, Garden of berries, perch of birds, Pasture of pool-haunting herds, Graced by each change of sum untold, Earth-baking heat, stone-cleaving cold.
The Titan heeds his sky-affairs, Rich rents and wide alliance shares; Mysteries of color daily laid By morn and eve in light and shade; And sweet varieties of chance, And the mystic seasons' dance; And thief-like step of liberal hours Thawing snow-drift into flowers.
O, wondrous craft of plant and stone By eldest science wrought and shown! 'Happy,' I said, 'whose home is here!
Fair fortunes to the mountaineer!
Boon Nature to his poorest shed Has royal pleasure-grounds outspread.' Intent, I searched the region round, And in low hut the dweller found: Woe is me for my hope's downfall!
Is yonder squalid peasant all That this proud nursery could breed For God's vicegerency and stead?
Time out of mind, this forge of ores; Quarry of spars in mountain pores; Old cradle, hunting-ground and bier Of wolf and otter, bear and deer; Well-built abode of many a race; Tower of observance searching space; Factory of river and of rain; Link in the Alps' globe-girding chain; By million changes skilled to tell What in the Eternal standeth well, And what obedient Nature can;— Is this colossal talisman Kindly to plant and blood and kind, But speechless to the master's mind?
I thought to find the patriots In whom the stock of freedom roots; To myself I oft recount Tales of many a famous mount,— Wales, Scotland, Uri, Hungary's dells: Bards, Roys, Scanderbegs and Tells; And think how Nature in these towers Uplifted shall condense her powers, And lifting man to the blue deep Where stars their perfect courses keep, Like wise preceptor, lure his eye To sound the science of the sky, And carry learning to its height Of untried power and sane delight: The Indian cheer, the frosty skies, Rear purer wits, inventive eyes,— Eyes that frame cities where none be, And hands that stablish what these see: And by the moral of his place Hint summits of heroic grace; Man in these crags a fastness find To fight pollution of the mind; In the wide thaw and ooze of wrong, Adhere like this foundation strong, The insanity of towns to stem With simpleness for stratagem.
But if the brave old mould is broke, And end in churls the mountain folk In tavern cheer and tavern joke, Sink, O mountain, in the swamp!
Hide in thy skies, O sovereign lamp!
Perish like leaves, the highland breed No sire survive, no son succeed!
Soft! let not the offended muse Toil's hard hap with scorn accuse.
Many hamlets sought I then, Many farms of mountain men.
Rallying round a parish steeple Nestle warm the highland people, Coarse and boisterous, yet mild, Strong as giant, slow as child.
Sweat and season are their arts, Their talismans are ploughs and carts; And well the youngest can command Honey from the frozen land; With cloverheads the swamp adorn, Change the running sand to corn; For wolf and fox, bring lowing herds, And for cold mosses, cream and curds: Weave wood to canisters and mats; Drain sweet maple juice in vats.
No bird is safe that cuts the air From their rifle or their snare; No fish, in river or in lake, But their long hands it thence will take; Whilst the country's flinty face, Like wax, their fashioning skill betrays, To fill the hollows, sink the hills, Bridge gulfs, drain swamps, build dams and mills, And fit the bleak and howling waste For homes of virtue, sense and taste.
The World-soul knows his own affair, Forelooking, when he would prepare For the next ages, men of mould Well embodied, well ensouled, He cools the present's fiery glow, Sets the life-pulse strong but slow: Bitter winds and fasts austere His quarantines and grottoes, where He slowly cures decrepit flesh, And brings it infantile and fresh.
Toil and tempest are the toys And games to breathe his stalwart boys: They bide their time, and well can prove, If need were, their line from Jove; Of the same stuff, and so allayed, As that whereof the sun is made, And of the fibre, quick and strong, Whose throbs are love, whose thrills are song.
Now in sordid weeds they sleep, In dulness now their secret keep; Yet, will you learn our ancient speech, These the masters who can teach.
Fourscore or a hundred words All their vocal muse affords; But they turn them in a fashion Past clerks' or statesmen's art or passion.
I can spare the college bell, And the learned lecture, well; Spare the clergy and libraries, Institutes and dictionaries, For that hardy English root Thrives here, unvalued, underfoot.
Rude poets of the tavern hearth, Squandering your unquoted mirth, Which keeps the ground and never soars, While Jake retorts and Reuben roars; Scoff of yeoman strong and stark, Goes like bullet to its mark; While the solid curse and jeer Never balk the waiting ear.
On the summit as I stood, O'er the floor of plain and flood Seemed to me, the towering hill Was not altogether still, But a quiet sense conveyed: If I err not, thus it said:— 'Many feet in summer seek, Oft, my far-appearing peak; In the dreaded winter time, None save dappling shadows climb, Under clouds, my lonely head, Old as the sun, old almost as the shade; And comest thou To see strange forests and new snow, And tread uplifted land?
And leavest thou thy lowland race, Here amid clouds to stand?
And wouldst be my companion Where I gaze, and still shall gaze, Through tempering nights and flashing days, When forests fall, and man is gone, Over tribes and over times, At the burning Lyre, Nearing me, With its stars of northern fire, In many a thousand years? 'Gentle pilgrim, if thou know The gamut old of Pan, And how the hills began, The frank blessings of the hill Fall on thee, as fall they will. 'Let him heed who can and will; Enchantment fixed me here To stand the hurts of time, until In mightier chant I disappear.
If thou trowest How the chemic eddies play, Pole to pole, and what they say; And that these gray crags Not on crags are hung, But beads are of a rosary On prayer and music strung; And, credulous, through the granite seeming, Seest the smile of Reason beaming;— Can thy style-discerning eye The hidden-working Builder spy, Who builds, yet makes no chips, no din, With hammer soft as snowflake's flight;— Knowest thou this?
O pilgrim, wandering not amiss!
Already my rocks lie light, And soon my cone will spin. 'For the world was built in order, And the atoms march in tune; Rhyme the pipe, and Time the warder, The sun obeys them and the moon.
Orb and atom forth they prance, When they hear from far the rune; None so backward in the troop, When the music and the dance Reach his place and circumstance, But knows the sun-creating sound, And, though a pyramid, will bound. 'Monadnoc is a mountain strong, Tall and good my kind among; But well I know, no mountain can, Zion or Meru, measure with man.
For it is on zodiacs writ, Adamant is soft to wit: And when the greater comes again With my secret in his brain, I shall pass, as glides my shadow Daily over hill and meadow. 'Through all time, in light, in gloom Well I hear the approaching feet On the flinty pathway beat Of him that cometh, and shall come; Of him who shall as lightly bear My daily load of woods and streams, As doth this round sky-cleaving boat Which never strains its rocky beams; Whose timbers, as they silent float, Alps and Caucasus uprear, And the long Alleghanies here, And all town-sprinkled lands that be, Sailing through stars with all their history. 'Every morn I lift my head, See New England underspread, South from Saint Lawrence to the Sound, From Katskill east to the sea-bound.
Anchored fast for many an age, I await the bard and sage, Who, in large thoughts, like fair pearl-seed, Shall string Monadnoc like a bead.
Comes that cheerful troubadour, This mound shall throb his face before, As when, with inward fires and pain, It rose a bubble from the plain.
When he cometh, I shall shed, From this wellspring in my head, Fountain-drop of spicier worth Than all vintage of the earth.
There's fruit upon my barren soil Costlier far than wine or oil.
There's a berry blue and gold,— Autumn-ripe, its juices hold Sparta's stoutness, Bethlehem's heart, Asia's rancor, Athens' art, Slowsure Britain's secular might, And the German's inward sight.
I will give my son to eat Best of Pan's immortal meat, Bread to eat, and juice to drain; So the coinage of his brain Shall not be forms of stars, but stars, Nor pictures pale, but Jove and Mars, He comes, but not of that race bred Who daily climb my specular head.
Oft as morning wreathes my scarf, Fled the last plumule of the Dark, Pants up hither the spruce clerk From South Cove and City Wharf.
I take him up my rugged sides, Half-repentant, scant of breath,— Bead-eyes my granite chaos show, And my midsummer snow: Open the daunting map beneath,— All his county, sea and land, Dwarfed to measure of his hand; His day's ride is a furlong space, His city-tops a glimmering haze.
I plant his eyes on the sky-hoop bounding; ""See there the grim gray rounding Of the bullet of the earth Whereon ye sail, Tumbling steep In the uncontinented deep."" He looks on that, and he turns pale. 'T is even so, this treacherous kite, Farm-furrowed, town-incrusted sphere, Thoughtless of its anxious freight, Plunges eyeless on forever; And he, poor parasite, Cooped in a ship he cannot steer,— Who is the captain he knows not, Port or pilot trows not,— Risk or ruin he must share.
I scowl on him with my cloud, With my north wind chill his blood; I lame him, clattering down the rocks; And to live he is in fear.
Then, at last, I let him down Once more into his dapper town, To chatter, frightened, to his clan And forget me if he can.' As in the old poetic fame The gods are blind and lame, And the simular despite Betrays the more abounding might, So call not waste that barren cone Above the floral zone, Where forests starve: It is pure use;— What sheaves like those which here we glean and bind Of a celestial Ceres and the Muse?
Ages are thy days, Thou grand affirmer of the present tense, And type of permanence!
Firm ensign of the fatal Being, Amid these coward shapes of joy and grief, That will not bide the seeing!
Hither we bring Our insect miseries to thy rocks; And the whole flight, with folded wing, Vanish, and end their murmuring,— Vanish beside these dedicated blocks, Which who can tell what mason laid?
Spoils of a front none need restore, Replacing frieze and architrave;— Where flowers each stone rosette and metope brave; Still is the haughty pile erect Of the old building Intellect.
Complement of human kind, Holding us at vantage still, Our sumptuous indigence, O barren mound, thy plenties fill!
We fool and prate; Thou art silent and sedate.
To myriad kinds and times one sense The constant mountain doth dispense; Shedding on all its snows and leaves, One joy it joys, one grief it grieves.
Thou seest, O watchman tall, Our towns and races grow and fall, And imagest the stable good For which we all our lifetime grope, In shifting form the formless mind, And though the substance us elude, We in thee the shadow find.
Thou, in our astronomy An opaker star, Seen haply from afar, Above the horizon's hoop, A moment, by the railway troop, As o'er some bolder height they speed,— By circumspect ambition, By errant gain, By feasters and the frivolous,— Recallest us, And makest sane.
Mute orator! well skilled to plead, And send conviction without phrase, Thou dost succor and remede The shortness of our days, And promise, on thy Founder's truth, Long morrow to this mortal youth."
FABLE,"The mountain and the squirrel Had a quarrel, And the former called the latter 'Little Prig; Bun replied, 'You are doubtless very big; But all sorts of things and weather Must be taken in together, To make up a year And a sphere.
And I think it no disgrace To occupy my place.
If I'm not so large as you, You are not so small as I, And not half so spry.
I'll not deny you make A very pretty squirrel track; Talents differ; all is well and wisely put; If I cannot carry forests on my back, Neither can you crack a nut.'"
     INSCRIBED TO W.H. CHANNING,"Though loath to grieve The evil time's sole patriot, I cannot leave My honied thought For the priest's cant, Or statesman's rant.

There are two laws discrete, Not reconciled,— Law for man, and law for thing; The last builds town and fleet, But it runs wild, And doth the man unking. 'T is fit the forest fall, The steep be graded, The mountain tunnelled, The sand shaded, The orchard planted, The glebe tilled, The prairie granted, The steamer built.
Let man serve law for man; Live for friendship, live for love, For truth's and harmony's behoof; The state may follow how it can, As Olympus follows Jove.
Yet do not I implore The wrinkled shopman to my sounding woods, Nor bid the unwilling senator Ask votes of thrushes in the solitudes.
Every one to his chosen work;— Foolish hands may mix and mar; Wise and sure the issues are.
Round they roll till dark is light, Sex to sex, and even to odd;— The over-god Who marries Right to Might, Who peoples, unpeoples,— He who exterminates Races by stronger races, Black by white faces,— Knows to bring honey Out of the lion; Grafts gentlest scion On pirate and Turk.
The Cossack eats Poland, Like stolen fruit; Her last noble is ruined, Her last poet mute: Straight, into double band The victors divide; Half for freedom strike and stand;— The astonished Muse finds thousands at her side."
ASTRAEA,"Each the herald is who wrote His rank, and quartered his own coat.
There is no king nor sovereign state That can fix a hero's rate; Each to all is venerable, Cap-a-pie invulnerable, Until he write, where all eyes rest, Slave or master on his breast.
I saw men go up and down, In the country and the town, With this tablet on their neck, 'Judgment and a judge we seek.' Not to monarchs they repair, Nor to learned jurist's chair; But they hurry to their peers, To their kinsfolk and their dears; Louder than with speech they pray,— 'What am I? companion, say.' And the friend not hesitates To assign just place and mates; Answers not in word or letter, Yet is understood the better; Each to each a looking-glass, Reflects his figure that doth pass.
Every wayfarer he meets What himself declared repeats, What himself confessed records, Sentences him in his words; The form is his own corporal form, And his thought the penal worm.
Yet shine forever virgin minds, Loved by stars and purest winds, Which, o'er passion throned sedate, Have not hazarded their state; Disconcert the searching spy, Rendering to a curious eye The durance of a granite ledge.
To those who gaze from the sea's edge It is there for benefit; It is there for purging light; There for purifying storms; And its depths reflect all forms; It cannot parley with the mean,— Pure by impure is not seen.
For there's no sequestered grot, Lone mountain tarn, or isle forgot, But Justice, journeying in the sphere, Daily stoops to harbor there."
     ÉTIENNE DE LA BOÉCE,"I serve you not, if you I follow, Shadowlike, o'er hill and hollow; And bend my fancy to your leading, All too nimble for my treading.
When the pilgrimage is done, And we've the landscape overrun, I am bitter, vacant, thwarted, And your heart is unsupported.
Vainly valiant, you have missed The manhood that should yours resist,— Its complement; but if I could, In severe or cordial mood, Lead you rightly to my altar, Where the wisest Muses falter, And worship that world-warming spark Which dazzles me in midnight dark, Equalizing small and large, While the soul it doth surcharge, Till the poor is wealthy grown, And the hermit never alone,— The traveller and the road seem one With the errand to be done,— That were a man's and lover's part, That were Freedom's whitest chart."
COMPENSATION,"Why should I keep holiday When other men have none?
Why but because, when these are gay, I sit and mourn alone?
And why, when mirth unseals all tongues, Should mine alone be dumb?
Ah! late I spoke to silent throngs, And now their hour is come."
FORBEARANCE,"Hast thou named all the birds without a gun?
Loved the wood-rose, and left it on its stalk?
At rich men's tables eaten bread and pulse?
Unarmed, faced danger with a heart of trust?
And loved so well a high behavior, In man or maid, that thou from speech refrained, Nobility more nobly to repay?
O, be my friend, and teach me to be thine!"
THE PARK,"The prosperous and beautiful To me seem not to wear The yoke of conscience masterful, Which galls me everywhere.
I cannot shake off the god; On my neck he makes his seat; I look at my face in the glass,— My eyes his eyeballs meet.
Enchanters!
Enchantresses!
Your gold makes you seem wise; The morning mist within your grounds More proudly rolls, more softly lies.
Yet spake yon purple mountain, Yet said yon ancient wood, That Night or Day, that Love or Crime, Leads all souls to the Good."
FORERUNNERS,"Long I followed happy guides, I could never reach their sides; Their step is forth, and, ere the day Breaks up their leaguer, and away.
Keen my sense, my heart was young, Right good-will my sinews strung, But no speed of mine avails To hunt upon their shining trails.
On and away, their hasting feet Make the morning proud and sweet; Flowers they strew,—I catch the scent; Or tone of silver instrument Leaves on the wind melodious trace; Yet I could never see their face.
On eastern hills I see their smokes, Mixed with mist by distant lochs.
I met many travellers Who the road had surely kept; They saw not my fine revellers,— These had crossed them while they slept.
Some had heard their fair report, In the country or the court.
Fleetest couriers alive Never yet could once arrive, As they went or they returned, At the house where these sojourned.
Sometimes their strong speed they slacken, Though they are not overtaken; In sleep their jubilant troop is near,— I tuneful voices overhear; It may be in wood or waste,— At unawares 't is come and past.
Their near camp my spirit knows By signs gracious as rainbows.
I thenceforward and long after Listen for their harp-like laughter, And carry in my heart, for days, Peace that hallows rudest ways."
SURSUM CORDA,"Seek not the spirit, if it hide Inexorable to thy zeal: Trembler, do not whine and chide: Art thou not also real?
Stoop not then to poor excuse; Turn on the accuser roundly; say, 'Here am I, here will I abide Forever to myself soothfast; Go thou, sweet Heaven, or at thy pleasure stay!' Already Heaven with thee its lot has cast, For only it can absolutely deal."
ODE TO BEAUTY,"Who gave thee, O Beauty, The keys of this breast,— Too credulous lover Of blest and unblest?
Say, when in lapsed ages Thee knew I of old?
Or what was the service For which I was sold?
When first my eyes saw thee, I found me thy thrall, By magical drawings, Sweet tyrant of all!
I drank at thy fountain False waters of thirst; Thou intimate stranger, Thou latest and first!
Thy dangerous glances Make women of men; New-born, we are melting Into nature again.
Lavish, lavish promiser, Nigh persuading gods to err!
Guest of million painted forms, Which in turn thy glory warms!
The frailest leaf, the mossy bark, The acorn's cup, the raindrop's arc, The swinging spider's silver line, The ruby of the drop of wine, The shining pebble of the pond, Thou inscribest with a bond, In thy momentary play, Would bankrupt nature to repay.
Ah, what avails it To hide or to shun Whom the Infinite One Hath granted his throne?
The heaven high over Is the deep's lover; The sun and sea, Informed by thee, Before me run And draw me on, Yet fly me still, As Fate refuses To me the heart Fate for me chooses.
Is it that my opulent soul Was mingled from the generous whole; Sea-valleys and the deep of skies Furnished several supplies; And the sands whereof I'm made Draw me to them, self-betrayed?
I turn the proud portfolio Which holds the grand designs Of Salvator, of Guercino, And Piranesi's lines.
I hear the lofty paeans Of the masters of the shell, Who heard the starry music And recount the numbers well; Olympian bards who sung Divine Ideas below, Which always find us young And always keep us so.
Oft, in streets or humblest places, I detect far-wandered graces, Which, from Eden wide astray, In lowly homes have lost their way.
Thee gliding through the sea of form, Like the lightning through the storm, Somewhat not to be possessed, Somewhat not to be caressed, No feet so fleet could ever find, No perfect form could ever bind.
Thou eternal fugitive, Hovering over all that live, Quick and skilful to inspire Sweet, extravagant desire, Starry space and lily-bell Filling with thy roseate smell, Wilt not give the lips to taste Of the nectar which thou hast.
All that's good and great with thee Works in close conspiracy; Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely To report thy features only, And the cold and purple morning Itself with thoughts of thee adorning; The leafy dell, the city mart, Equal trophies of thine art; E'en the flowing azure air Thou hast touched for my despair; And, if I languish into dreams, Again I meet the ardent beams.
Queen of things!
I dare not die In Being's deeps past ear and eye; Lest there I find the same deceiver And be the sport of Fate forever.
Dread Power, but dear! if God thou be, Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me!"
GIVE ALL TO LOVE,"Give all to love; Obey thy heart; Friends, kindred, days, Estate, good-fame, Plans, credit and the Muse,— Nothing refuse. 'T is a brave master; Let it have scope: Follow it utterly, Hope beyond hope: High and more high It dives into noon, With wing unspent, Untold intent; But it is a god, Knows its own path And the outlets of the sky.
It was never for the mean; It requireth courage stout.
Souls above doubt, Valor unbending, It will reward,— They shall return More than they were, And ever ascending.
Leave all for love; Yet, hear me, yet, One word more thy heart behoved, One pulse more of firm endeavor,— Keep thee to-day, To-morrow, forever, Free as an Arab Of thy beloved.
Cling with life to the maid; But when the surprise, First vague shadow of surmise Flits across her bosom young, Of a joy apart from thee, Free be she, fancy-free; Nor thou detain her vesture's hem, Nor the palest rose she flung From her summer diadem.
Though thou loved her as thyself, As a self of purer clay, Though her parting dims the day, Stealing grace from all alive; Heartily know, When half-gods go.
The gods arrive."
TO ELLEN AT THE SOUTH,"The green grass is bowing, The morning wind is in it; 'T is a tune worth thy knowing, Though it change every minute. 'T is a tune of the Spring; Every year plays it over To the robin on the wing, And to the pausing lover.
O'er ten thousand, thousand acres, Goes light the nimble zephyr; The Flowers—tiny sect of Shakers— Worship him ever.
Hark to the winning sound!
They summon thee, dearest,— Saying, 'We have dressed for thee the ground, Nor yet thou appearest. 'O hasten;' 't is our time, Ere yet the red Summer Scorch our delicate prime, Loved of bee,—the tawny hummer. 'O pride of thy race!
Sad, in sooth, it were to ours, If our brief tribe miss thy face, We poor New England flowers. 'Fairest, choose the fairest members Of our lithe society; June's glories and September's Show our love and piety. 'Thou shalt command us all,— April's cowslip, summer's clover, To the gentian in the fall, Blue-eyed pet of blue-eyed lover. 'O come, then, quickly come!
We are budding, we are blowing; And the wind that we perfume Sings a tune that's worth the knowing.'"
TO ELLEN,"And Ellen, when the graybeard years Have brought us to life's evening hour, And all the crowded Past appears A tiny scene of sun and shower, Then, if I read the page aright Where Hope, the soothsayer, reads our lot, Thyself shalt own the page was bright, Well that we loved, woe had we not, When Mirth is dumb and Flattery's fled, And mute thy music's dearest tone, When all but Love itself is dead And all but deathless Reason gone."
TO EVA,"O fair and stately maid, whose eyes Were kindled in the upper skies At the same torch that lighted mine; For so I must interpret still Thy sweet dominion o'er my will, A sympathy divine.
Ah! let me blameless gaze upon Features that seem at heart my own; Nor fear those watchful sentinels, Who charm the more their glance forbids, Chaste-glowing, underneath their lids, With fire that draws while it repels."
     HER MARRIAGE TO MR. EMERSON,"Love scatters oil On Life's dark sea, Sweetens its toil— Our helmsman he.
Around him hover Odorous clouds; Under this cover His arrows he shrouds.
The cloud was around me, I knew not why Such sweetness crowned me.
While Time shot by.
No pain was within, But calm delight, Like a world without sin, Or a day without night.
The shafts of the god Were tipped with down, For they drew no blood, And they knit no frown.
I knew of them not Until Cupid laughed loud, And saying ""You're caught!"" Flew off in the cloud.
O then I awoke, And I lived but to sigh, Till a clear voice spoke,— And my tears are dry."
     BY ELLEN LOUISA TUCKER,"Why lingerest thou, pale violet, to see the dying year; Are Autumn's blasts fit music for thee, fragile one, to hear; Will thy clear blue eye, upward bent, still keep its chastened glow, Still tearless lift its slender form above the wintry snow?
Why wilt thou live when none around reflects thy pensive ray?
Thou bloomest here a lonely thing in the clear autumn day.
The tall green trees, that shelter thee, their last gay dress put on; There will be nought to shelter thee when their sweet leaves are gone.
O Violet, like thee, how blest could I lie down and die, When summer light is fading, and autumn breezes sigh; When Winter reigned I'd close my eye, but wake with bursting Spring, And live with living nature, a pure rejoicing thing.
I had a sister once who seemed just like a violet; Her morning sun shone bright and calmly purely set; When the violets were in their shrouds, and Summer in its pride, She laid her hopes at rest, and in the year's rich beauty died."
THE AMULET,"Your picture smiles as first it smiled; The ring you gave is still the same; Your letter tells, O changing child!
No tidings since it came.
Give me an amulet That keeps intelligence with you,— Red when you love, and rosier red, And when you love not, pale and blue.
Alas! that neither bonds nor vows Can certify possession; Torments me still the fear that love Died in its last expression."
THINE EYES STILL SHINED,"Thine eyes still shined for me, though far I lonely roved the land or sea: As I behold yon evening star, Which yet beholds not me.
This morn I climbed the misty hill And roamed the pastures through; How danced thy form before my path Amidst the deep-eyed dew!
When the redbird spread his sable wing, And showed his side of flame; When the rosebud ripened to the rose, In both I read thy name."
EROS,"The sense of the world is short,— Long and various the report,— To love and be beloved; Men and gods have not outlearned it; And, how oft soe'er they've turned it, Not to be improved."
HERMIONE,"On a mound an Arab lay, And sung his sweet regrets And told his amulets: The summer bird His sorrow heard, And, when he heaved a sigh profound, The sympathetic swallow swept the ground. 'If it be, as they said, she was not fair, Beauty's not beautiful to me, But sceptred genius, aye inorbed, Culminating in her sphere.
This Hermione absorbed The lustre of the land and ocean, Hills and islands, cloud and tree, In her form and motion. 'I ask no bauble miniature, Nor ringlets dead Shorn from her comely head, Now that morning not disdains Mountains and the misty plains Her colossal portraiture; They her heralds be, Steeped in her quality, And singers of her fame Who is their Muse and dame. 'Higher, dear swallows! mind not what I say.
Ah! heedless how the weak are strong, Say, was it just, In thee to frame, in me to trust, Thou to the Syrian couldst belong? 'I am of a lineage That each for each doth fast engage; In old Bassora's schools, I seemed Hermit vowed to books and gloom,— Ill-bestead for gay bridegroom.
I was by thy touch redeemed; When thy meteor glances came, We talked at large of worldly fate, And drew truly every trait. 'Once I dwelt apart, Now I live with all; As shepherd's lamp on far hill-side Seems, by the traveller espied, A door into the mountain heart, So didst thou quarry and unlock Highways for me through the rock. 'Now, deceived, thou wanderest In strange lands unblest; And my kindred come to soothe me.
Southwind is my next of blood; He is come through fragrant wood, Drugged with spice from climates warm, And in every twinkling glade, And twilight nook, Unveils thy form.
Out of the forest way Forth paced it yesterday; And when I sat by the watercourse, Watching the daylight fade, It throbbed up from the brook. 'River and rose and crag and bird, Frost and sun and eldest night, To me their aid preferred, To me their comfort plight;— ""Courage! we are thine allies, And with this hint be wise,— The chains of kind The distant bind; Deed thou doest she must do, Above her will, be true; And, in her strict resort To winds and waterfalls And autumn's sunlit festivals, To music, and to music's thought, Inextricably bound, She shall find thee, and be found.
Follow not her flying feet; Come to us herself to meet.""'"
     I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"Venus, when her son was lost, Cried him up and down the coast, In hamlets, palaces and parks, And told the truant by his marks,— Golden curls, and quiver and bow.
This befell how long ago!
Time and tide are strangely changed, Men and manners much deranged: None will now find Cupid latent By this foolish antique patent.
He came late along the waste, Shod like a traveller for haste; With malice dared me to proclaim him, That the maids and boys might name him.
Boy no more, he wears all coats, Frocks and blouses, capes, capotes; He bears no bow, or quiver, or wand, Nor chaplet on his head or hand.
Leave his weeds and heed his eyes,— All the rest he can disguise.
In the pit of his eye's a spark Would bring back day if it were dark; And, if I tell you all my thought, Though I comprehend it not, In those unfathomable orbs Every function he absorbs; Doth eat, and drink, and fish, and shoot, And write, and reason, and compute, And ride, and run, and have, and hold, And whine, and flatter, and regret, And kiss, and couple, and beget, By those roving eyeballs bold.
Undaunted are their courages, Right Cossacks in their forages; Fleeter they than any creature,— They are his steeds, and not his feature; Inquisitive, and fierce, and fasting, Restless, predatory, hasting; And they pounce on other eyes As lions on their prey; And round their circles is writ, Plainer than the day, Underneath, within, above,— Love—love—love—love.
He lives in his eyes; There doth digest, and work, and spin, And buy, and sell, and lose, and win; He rolls them with delighted motion, Joy-tides swell their mimic ocean.
Yet holds he them with tautest rein, That they may seize and entertain The glance that to their glance opposes, Like fiery honey sucked from roses.
He palmistry can understand, Imbibing virtue by his hand As if it were a living root; The pulse of hands will make him mute; With all his force he gathers balms Into those wise, thrilling palms.
Cupid is a casuist, A mystic and a cabalist,— Can your lurking thought surprise, And interpret your device.
He is versed in occult science, In magic and in clairvoyance, Oft he keeps his fine ear strained, And Reason on her tiptoe pained For aëry intelligence, And for strange coincidence.
But it touches his quick heart When Fate by omens takes his part, And chance-dropped hints from Nature's sphere Deeply soothe his anxious ear.
Heralds high before him run; He has ushers many a one; He spreads his welcome where he goes, And touches all things with his rose.
All things wait for and divine him,— How shall I dare to malign him, Or accuse the god of sport?
I must end my true report, Painting him from head to foot, In as far as I took note, Trusting well the matchless power Of this young-eyed emperor Will clear his fame from every cloud With the bards and with the crowd.
He is wilful, mutable, Shy, untamed, inscrutable, Swifter-fashioned than the fairies.
Substance mixed of pure contraries; His vice some elder virtue's token, And his good is evil-spoken.
Failing sometimes of his own, He is headstrong and alone; He affects the wood and wild, Like a flower-hunting child; Buries himself in summer waves, In trees, with beasts, in mines and caves, Loves nature like a hornèd cow, Bird, or deer, or caribou.
Shun him, nymphs, on the fleet horses!
He has a total world of wit; O how wise are his discourses!
But he is the arch-hypocrite, And, through all science and all art, Seeks alone his counterpart.
He is a Pundit of the East, He is an augur and a priest, And his soul will melt in prayer, But word and wisdom is a snare; Corrupted by the present toy He follows joy, and only joy.
There is no mask but he will wear; He invented oaths to swear; He paints, he carves, he chants, he prays, And holds all stars in his embrace.
He takes a sovran privilege Not allowed to any liege; For Cupid goes behind all law, And right into himself does draw; For he is sovereignly allied,— Heaven's oldest blood flows in his side,— And interchangeably at one With every king on every throne, That no god dare say him nay, Or see the fault, or seen betray; He has the Muses by the heart, And the stern Parcae on his part.
His many signs cannot be told; He has not one mode, but manifold, Many fashions and addresses, Piques, reproaches, hurts, caresses.
He will preach like a friar, And jump like Harlequin; He will read like a crier, And fight like a Paladin.
Boundless is his memory; Plans immense his term prolong; He is not of counted age, Meaning always to be young.
And his wish is intimacy, Intimater intimacy, And a stricter privacy; The impossible shall yet be done, And, being two, shall still be one.
As the wave breaks to foam on shelves, Then runs into a wave again, So lovers melt their sundered selves, Yet melted would be twain."
II. THE DAEMONIC LOVE,"Man was made of social earth, Child and brother from his birth, Tethered by a liquid cord Of blood through veins of kindred poured.
Next his heart the fireside band Of mother, father, sister, stand; Names from awful childhood heard Throbs of a wild religion stirred;— Virtue, to love, to hate them, vice; Till dangerous Beauty came, at last, Till Beauty came to snap all ties; The maid, abolishing the past, With lotus wine obliterates Dear memory's stone-incarved traits, And, by herself, supplants alone Friends year by year more inly known.
When her calm eyes opened bright, All else grew foreign in their light.
It was ever the self-same tale, The first experience will not fail; Only two in the garden walked, And with snake and seraph talked.
Close, close to men, Like undulating layer of air, Right above their heads, The potent plain of Daemons spreads.
Stands to each human soul its own, For watch and ward and furtherance, In the snares of Nature's dance; And the lustre and the grace To fascinate each youthful heart, Beaming from its counterpart, Translucent through the mortal covers, Is the Daemon's form and face.
To and fro the Genius hies,— A gleam which plays and hovers Over the maiden's head, And dips sometimes as low as to her eyes.
Unknown, albeit lying near, To men, the path to the Daemon sphere; And they that swiftly come and go Leave no track on the heavenly snow.
Sometimes the airy synod bends, And the mighty choir descends, And the brains of men thenceforth, In crowded and in still resorts, Teem with unwonted thoughts: As, when a shower of meteors Cross the orbit of the earth, And, lit by fringent air, Blaze near and far, Mortals deem the planets bright Have slipped their sacred bars, And the lone seaman all the night Sails, astonished, amid stars.
Beauty of a richer vein, Graces of a subtler strain, Unto men these moonmen lend, And our shrinking sky extend.
So is man's narrow path By strength and terror skirted; Also (from the song the wrath Of the Genii be averted!
The Muse the truth uncolored speaking) The Daemons are self-seeking: Their fierce and limitary will Draws men to their likeness still.
The erring painter made Love blind,— Highest Love who shines on all; Him, radiant, sharpest-sighted god, None can bewilder; Whose eyes pierce The universe, Path-finder, road-builder, Mediator, royal giver; Rightly seeing, rightly seen, Of joyful and transparent mien. 'T is a sparkle passing From each to each, from thee to me, To and fro perpetually; Sharing all, daring all, Levelling, displacing Each obstruction, it unites Equals remote, and seeming opposites.
And ever and forever Love Delights to build a road: Unheeded Danger near him strides, Love laughs, and on a lion rides.
But Cupid wears another face, Born into Daemons less divine: His roses bleach apace, His nectar smacks of wine.
The Daemon ever builds a wall, Himself encloses and includes, Solitude in solitudes: In like sort his love doth fall.
He doth elect The beautiful and fortunate, And the sons of intellect, And the souls of ample fate, Who the Future's gates unbar,— Minions of the Morning Star.
In his prowess he exults, And the multitude insults.
His impatient looks devour Oft the humble and the poor; And, seeing his eye glare, They drop their few pale flowers, Gathered with hope to please, Along the mountain towers,— Lose courage, and despair.
He will never be gainsaid,— Pitiless, will not be stayed; His hot tyranny Burns up every other tie.
Therefore comes an hour from Jove Which his ruthless will defies, And the dogs of Fate unties.
Shiver the palaces of glass; Shrivel the rainbow-colored walls, Where in bright Art each god and sibyl dwelt Secure as in the zodiac's belt; And the galleries and halls, Wherein every siren sung, Like a meteor pass.
For this fortune wanted root In the core of God's abysm,— Was a weed of self and schism; And ever the Daemonic Love Is the ancestor of wars And the parent of remorse."
III. THE CELESTIAL LOVE,"But God said, 'I will have a purer gift; There is smoke in the flame; New flowerets bring, new prayers uplift, And love without a name.
Fond children, ye desire To please each other well; Another round, a higher, Ye shall climb on the heavenly stair, And selfish preference forbear; And in right deserving, And without a swerving Each from your proper state, Weave roses for your mate. 'Deep, deep are loving eyes, Flowed with naphtha fiery sweet; And the point is paradise, Where their glances meet: Their reach shall yet be more profound, And a vision without bound: The axis of those eyes sun-clear Be the axis of the sphere: So shall the lights ye pour amain Go, without check or intervals, Through from the empyrean walls Unto the same again.' Higher far into the pure realm, Over sun and star, Over the flickering Daemon film, Thou must mount for love; Into vision where all form In one only form dissolves; In a region where the wheel On which all beings ride Visibly revolves; Where the starred, eternal worm Girds the world with bound and term; Where unlike things are like; Where good and ill, And joy and moan, Melt into one.
There Past, Present, Future, shoot Triple blossoms from one root; Substances at base divided, In their summits are united; There the holy essence rolls, One through separated souls; And the sunny Aeon sleeps Folding Nature in its deeps, And every fair and every good, Known in part, or known impure, To men below, In their archetypes endure.
The race of gods, Or those we erring own, Are shadows flitting up and down In the still abodes.
The circles of that sea are laws Which publish and which hide the cause.
Pray for a beam Out of that sphere, Thee to guide and to redeem.
O, what a load Of care and toil, By lying use bestowed, From his shoulders falls who sees The true astronomy, The period of peace.
Counsel which the ages kept Shall the well-born soul accept.
As the overhanging trees Fill the lake with images,— As garment draws the garment's hem, Men their fortunes bring with them.
By right or wrong, Lands and goods go to the strong.
Property will brutely draw Still to the proprietor; Silver to silver creep and wind, And kind to kind.
Nor less the eternal poles Of tendency distribute souls.
There need no vows to bind Whom not each other seek, but find.
They give and take no pledge or oath,— Nature is the bond of both: No prayer persuades, no flattery fawns,— Their noble meanings are their pawns.
Plain and cold is their address, Power have they for tenderness; And, so thoroughly is known Each other's counsel by his own, They can parley without meeting; Need is none of forms of greeting; They can well communicate In their innermost estate; When each the other shall avoid, Shall each by each be most enjoyed.
Not with scarfs or perfumed gloves Do these celebrate their loves: Not by jewels, feasts and savors, Not by ribbons or by favors, But by the sun-spark on the sea, And the cloud-shadow on the lea, The soothing lapse of morn to mirk, And the cheerful round of work.
Their cords of love so public are, They intertwine the farthest star: The throbbing sea, the quaking earth, Yield sympathy and signs of mirth; Is none so high, so mean is none, But feels and seals this union; Even the fell Furies are appeased, The good applaud, the lost are eased.
Love's hearts are faithful, but not fond, Bound for the just, but not beyond; Not glad, as the low-loving herd, Of self in other still preferred, But they have heartily designed The benefit of broad mankind.
And they serve men austerely, After their own genius, clearly, Without a false humility; For this is Love's nobility,— Not to scatter bread and gold, Goods and raiment bought and sold; But to hold fast his simple sense, And speak the speech of innocence, And with hand and body and blood, To make his bosom-counsel good.
He that feeds men serveth few; He serves all who dares be true."
THE APOLOGY,"Think me not unkind and rude That I walk alone in grove and glen; I go to the god of the wood To fetch his word to men.
Tax not my sloth that I Fold my arms beside the brook; Each cloud that floated in the sky Writes a letter in my book.
Chide me not, laborious band, For the idle flowers I brought; Every aster in my hand Goes home loaded with a thought.
There was never mystery But 'tis figured in the flowers; Was never secret history But birds tell it in the bowers.
One harvest from thy field Homeward brought the oxen strong; A second crop thine acres yield, Which I gather in a song."
MERLIN I,"Thy trivial harp will never please Or fill my craving ear; Its chords should ring as blows the breeze, Free, peremptory, clear.
No jingling serenader's art, Nor tinkle of piano strings, Can make the wild blood start In its mystic springs.
The kingly bard Must smite the chords rudely and hard, As with hammer or with mace; That they may render back Artful thunder, which conveys Secrets of the solar track, Sparks of the supersolar blaze.
Merlin's blows are strokes of fate, Chiming with the forest tone, When boughs buffet boughs in the wood; Chiming with the gasp and moan Of the ice-imprisoned flood; With the pulse of manly hearts; With the voice of orators; With the din of city arts; With the cannonade of wars; With the marches of the brave; And prayers of might from martyrs' cave.
Great is the art, Great be the manners, of the bard.
He shall not his brain encumber With the coil of rhythm and number; But, leaving rule and pale forethought, He shall aye climb For his rhyme. 'Pass in, pass in,' the angels say, 'In to the upper doors, Nor count compartments of the floors, But mount to paradise By the stairway of surprise.' Blameless master of the games, King of sport that never shames, He shall daily joy dispense Hid in song's sweet influence.
Forms more cheerly live and go, What time the subtle mind Sings aloud the tune whereto Their pulses beat, And march their feet, And their members are combined.
By Sybarites beguiled, He shall no task decline; Merlin's mighty line Extremes of nature reconciled,— Bereaved a tyrant of his will, And made the lion mild.
Songs can the tempest still, Scattered on the stormy air, Mould the year to fair increase, And bring in poetic peace.
He shall not seek to weave, In weak, unhappy times, Efficacious rhymes; Wait his returning strength.
Bird that from the nadir's floor To the zenith's top can soar,— The soaring orbit of the muse exceeds that journey's length.
Nor profane affect to hit Or compass that, by meddling wit, Which only the propitious mind Publishes when 't is inclined.
There are open hours When the God's will sallies free, And the dull idiot might see The flowing fortunes of a thousand years;— Sudden, at unawares, Self-moved, fly-to the doors.
Nor sword of angels could reveal What they conceal."
MERLIN II,"The rhyme of the poet Modulates the king's affairs; Balance-loving Nature Made all things in pairs.
To every foot its antipode; Each color with its counter glowed; To every tone beat answering tones, Higher or graver; Flavor gladly blends with flavor; Leaf answers leaf upon the bough; And match the paired cotyledons.
Hands to hands, and feet to feet, In one body grooms and brides; Eldest rite, two married sides In every mortal meet.
Light's far furnace shines, Smelting balls and bars, Forging double stars, Glittering twins and trines.
The animals are sick with love, Lovesick with rhyme; Each with all propitious Time Into chorus wove.
Like the dancers' ordered band, Thoughts come also hand in hand; In equal couples mated, Or else alternated; Adding by their mutual gage, One to other, health and age.
Solitary fancies go Short-lived wandering to and fro, Most like to bachelors, Or an ungiven maid, Not ancestors, With no posterity to make the lie afraid, Or keep truth undecayed.
Perfect-paired as eagle's wings, Justice is the rhyme of things; Trade and counting use The self-same tuneful muse; And Nemesis, Who with even matches odd, Who athwart space redresses The partial wrong, Fills the just period, And finishes the song.
Subtle rhymes, with ruin rife, Murmur in the house of life, Sung by the Sisters as they spin; In perfect time and measure they Build and unbuild our echoing clay.
As the two twilights of the day Fold us music-drunken in."
BACCHUS,"Bring me wine, but wine which never grew In the belly of the grape, Or grew on vine whose tap-roots, reaching through, Under the Andes to the Cape, Suffer no savor of the earth to scape.
Let its grapes the morn salute From a nocturnal root, Which feels the acrid juice Of Styx and Erebus; And turns the woe of Night, By its own craft, to a more rich delight.
We buy ashes for bread; We buy diluted wine; Give me of the true,— Whose ample leaves and tendrils curled Among the silver hills of heaven Draw everlasting dew; Wine of wine, Blood of the world, Form of forms, and mould of statures, That I intoxicated, And by the draught assimilated, May float at pleasure through all natures; The bird-language rightly spell, And that which roses say so well.
Wine that is shed Like the torrents of the sun Up the horizon walls, Or like the Atlantic streams, which run When the South Sea calls.
Water and bread, Food which needs no transmuting, Rainbow-flowering, wisdom-fruiting, Wine which is already man, Food which teach and reason can.
Wine which Music is,— Music and wine are one,— That I, drinking this, Shall hear far Chaos talk with me; Kings unborn shall walk with me; And the poor grass shall plot and plan What it will do when it is man.
Quickened so, will I unlock Every crypt of every rock.
I thank the joyful juice For all I know;— Winds of remembering Of the ancient being blow, And seeming-solid walls of use Open and flow.
Pour, Bacchus! the remembering wine; Retrieve the loss of me and mine!
Vine for vine be antidote, And the grape requite the lote!
Haste to cure the old despair,— Reason in Nature's lotus drenched, The memory of ages quenched; Give them again to shine; Let wine repair what this undid; And where the infection slid, A dazzling memory revive; Refresh the faded tints, Recut the aged prints, And write my old adventures with the pen Which on the first day drew, Upon the tablets blue, The dancing Pleiads and eternal men."
MEROPS,"What care I, so they stand the same,— Things of the heavenly mind,— How long the power to give them name Tarries yet behind?
Thus far to-day your favors reach, O fair, appeasing presences!
Ye taught my lips a single speech, And a thousand silences.
Space grants beyond his fated road No inch to the god of day; And copious language still bestowed One word, no more, to say."
THE HOUSE,"There is no architect Can build as the Muse can; She is skilful to select Materials for her plan; Slow and warily to choose Rafters of immortal pine, Or cedar incorruptible, Worthy her design, She threads dark Alpine forests Or valleys by the sea, In many lands, with painful steps, Ere she can find a tree.
She ransacks mines and ledges And quarries every rock, To hew the famous adamant For each eternal block— She lays her beams in music, In music every one, To the cadence of the whirling world Which dances round the sun— That so they shall not be displaced By lapses or by wars, But for the love of happy souls Outlive the newest stars."
SAADI,"Trees in groves, Kine in droves, In ocean sport the scaly herds, Wedge-like cleave the air the birds, To northern lakes fly wind-borne ducks, Browse the mountain sheep in flocks, Men consort in camp and town, But the poet dwells alone.
God, who gave to him the lyre, Of all mortals the desire, For all breathing men's behoof, Straitly charged him, 'Sit aloof;' Annexed a warning, poets say, To the bright premium,— Ever, when twain together play, Shall the harp be dumb.
Many may come, But one shall sing; Two touch the string, The harp is dumb.
Though there come a million, Wise Saadi dwells alone.
Yet Saadi loved the race of men,— No churl, immured in cave or den; In bower and hall He wants them all, Nor can dispense With Persia for his audience; They must give ear, Grow red with joy and white with fear; But he has no companion; Come ten, or come a million, Good Saadi dwells alone.
Be thou ware where Saadi dwells; Wisdom of the gods is he,— Entertain it reverently.
Gladly round that golden lamp Sylvan deities encamp, And simple maids and noble youth Are welcome to the man of truth.
Most welcome they who need him most, They feed the spring which they exhaust; For greater need Draws better deed: But, critic, spare thy vanity, Nor show thy pompous parts, To vex with odious subtlety The cheerer of men's hearts.
Sad-eyed Fakirs swiftly say Endless dirges to decay, Never in the blaze of light Lose the shudder of midnight; Pale at overflowing noon Hear wolves barking at the moon; In the bower of dalliance sweet Hear the far Avenger's feet: And shake before those awful Powers, Who in their pride forgive not ours.
Thus the sad-eyed Fakirs preach: 'Bard, when thee would Allah teach, And lift thee to his holy mount, He sends thee from his bitter fount Wormwood,—saying, ""Go thy ways; Drink not the Malaga of praise, But do the deed thy fellows hate, And compromise thy peaceful state; Smite the white breasts which thee fed.
Stuff sharp thorns beneath the head Of them thou shouldst have comforted; For out of woe and out of crime Draws the heart a lore sublime.""' And yet it seemeth not to me That the high gods love tragedy; For Saadi sat in the sun, And thanks was his contrition; For haircloth and for bloody whips, Had active hands and smiling lips; And yet his runes he rightly read, And to his folk his message sped.
Sunshine in his heart transferred Lighted each transparent word, And well could honoring Persia learn What Saadi wished to say; For Saadi's nightly stars did burn Brighter than Jami's day.
Whispered the Muse in Saadi's cot: 'O gentle Saadi, listen not, Tempted by thy praise of wit, Or by thirst and appetite For the talents not thine own, To sons of contradiction.
Never, son of eastern morning, Follow falsehood, follow scorning.
Denounce who will, who will deny, And pile the hills to scale the sky; Let theist, atheist, pantheist, Define and wrangle how they list, Fierce conserver, fierce destroyer,— But thou, joy-giver and enjoyer, Unknowing war, unknowing crime, Gentle Saadi, mind thy rhyme; Heed not what the brawlers say, Heed thou only Saadi's lay. 'Let the great world bustle on With war and trade, with camp and town; A thousand men shall dig and eat; At forge and furnace thousands sweat; And thousands sail the purple sea, And give or take the stroke of war, Or crowd the market and bazaar; Oft shall war end, and peace return, And cities rise where cities burn, Ere one man my hill shall climb, Who can turn the golden rhyme.
Let them manage how they may, Heed thou only Saadi's lay.
Seek the living among the dead,— Man in man is imprisonèd; Barefooted Dervish is not poor, If fate unlock his bosom's door, So that what his eye hath seen His tongue can paint as bright, as keen; And what his tender heart hath felt With equal fire thy heart shalt melt.
For, whom the Muses smile upon, And touch with soft persuasion, His words like a storm-wind can bring Terror and beauty on their wing; In his every syllable Lurketh Nature veritable; And though he speak in midnight dark,— In heaven no star, on earth no spark,— Yet before the listener's eye Swims the world in ecstasy, The forest waves, the morning breaks, The pastures sleep, ripple the lakes, Leaves twinkle, flowers like persons be, And life pulsates in rock or tree.
Saadi, so far thy words shall reach: Suns rise and set in Saadi's speech!' And thus to Saadi said the Muse: 'Eat thou the bread which men refuse; Flee from the goods which from thee flee; Seek nothing,—Fortune seeketh thee.
Nor mount, nor dive; all good things keep The midway of the eternal deep.
Wish not to fill the isles with eyes To fetch thee birds of paradise: On thine orchard's edge belong All the brags of plume and song; Wise Ali's sunbright sayings pass For proverbs in the market-place: Through mountains bored by regal art, Toil whistles as he drives his cart.
Nor scour the seas, nor sift mankind, A poet or a friend to find: Behold, he watches at the door!
Behold his shadow on the floor!
Open innumerable doors The heaven where unveiled Allah pours The flood of truth, the flood of good, The Seraph's and the Cherub's food.
Those doors are men: the Pariah hind Admits thee to the perfect Mind.
Seek not beyond thy cottage wall Redeemers that can yield thee all: While thou sittest at thy door On the desert's yellow floor, Listening to the gray-haired crones, Foolish gossips, ancient drones, Saadi, see! they rise in stature To the height of mighty Nature, And the secret stands revealed Fraudulent Time in vain concealed,— That blessed gods in servile masks Plied for thee thy household tasks.'"
HOLIDAYS,"From fall to spring, the russet acorn, Fruit beloved of maid and boy, Lent itself beneath the forest, To be the children's toy.
Pluck it now!
In vain,—thou canst not; Its root has pierced yon shady mound; Toy no longer—it has duties; It is anchored in the ground.
Year by year the rose-lipped maiden, Playfellow of young and old, Was frolic sunshine, dear to all men, More dear to one than mines of gold.
Whither went the lovely hoyden?
Disappeared in blessed wife; Servant to a wooden cradle, Living in a baby's life.
Still thou playest;—short vacation Fate grants each to stand aside; Now must thou be man and artist,— 'T is the turning of the tide."
XENOPHANES,"By fate, not option, frugal Nature gave One scent to hyson and to wall-flower, One sound to pine-groves and to waterfalls, One aspect to the desert and the lake.
It was her stern necessity: all things Are of one pattern made; bird, beast and flower, Song, picture, form, space, thought and character Deceive us, seeming to be many things, And are but one.
Beheld far off, they part As God and devil; bring them to the mind, They dull its edge with their monotony.
To know one element, explore another, And in the second reappears the first.
The specious panorama of a year But multiplies the image of a day,— A belt of mirrors round a taper's flame; And universal Nature, through her vast And crowded whole, an infinite paroquet, Repeats one note."
THE DAY'S RATION,"When I was born, From all the seas of strength Fate filled a chalice, Saying, 'This be thy portion, child; this chalice, Less than a lily's, thou shalt daily draw From my great arteries,—nor less, nor more.' All substances the cunning chemist Time Melts down into that liquor of my life,— Friends, foes, joys, fortunes, beauty and disgust.
And whether I am angry or content, Indebted or insulted, loved or hurt, All he distils into sidereal wine And brims my little cup; heedless, alas!
Of all he sheds how little it will hold, How much runs over on the desert sands.
If a new Muse draw me with splendid ray, And I uplift myself into its heaven, The needs of the first sight absorb my blood, And all the following hours of the day Drag a ridiculous age.
To-day, when friends approach, and every hour Brings book, or starbright scroll of genius, The little cup will hold not a bead more, And all the costly liquor runs to waste; Nor gives the jealous lord one diamond drop So to be husbanded for poorer days.
Why need I volumes, if one word suffice?
Why need I galleries, when a pupil's draught After the master's sketch fills and o'erfills My apprehension?
Why seek Italy, Who cannot circumnavigate the sea Of thoughts and things at home, but still adjourn The nearest matters for a thousand days?"
BLIGHT,"Give me truths; For I am weary of the surfaces, And die of inanition.
If I knew Only the herbs and simples of the wood, Rue, cinquefoil, gill, vervain and agrimony, Blue-vetch and trillium, hawkweed, sassafras, Milkweeds and murky brakes, quaint pipes and sundew, And rare and virtuous roots, which in these woods Draw untold juices from the common earth, Untold, unknown, and I could surely spell Their fragrance, and their chemistry apply By sweet affinities to human flesh, Driving the foe and stablishing the friend,— O, that were much, and I could be a part Of the round day, related to the sun And planted world, and full executor Of their imperfect functions.
But these young scholars, who invade our hills, Bold as the engineer who fells the wood, And travelling often in the cut he makes, Love not the flower they pluck, and know it not, And all their botany is Latin names.
The old men studied magic in the flowers, And human fortunes in astronomy, And an omnipotence in chemistry, Preferring things to names, for these were men, Were unitarians of the united world, And, wheresoever their clear eye-beams fell, They caught the footsteps of the SAME.
Our eyes Are armed, but we are strangers to the stars, And strangers to the mystic beast and bird, And strangers to the plant and to the mine.
The injured elements say, 'Not in us;' And night and day, ocean and continent, Fire, plant and mineral say, 'Not in us;' And haughtily return us stare for stare.
For we invade them impiously for gain; We devastate them unreligiously, And coldly ask their pottage, not their love.
Therefore they shove us from them, yield to us Only what to our griping toil is due; But the sweet affluence of love and song, The rich results of the divine consents Of man and earth, of world beloved and lover, The nectar and ambrosia, are withheld; And in the midst of spoils and slaves, we thieves And pirates of the universe, shut out Daily to a more thin and outward rind, Turn pale and starve.
Therefore, to our sick eyes, The stunted trees look sick, the summer short, Clouds shade the sun, which will not tan our hay, And nothing thrives to reach its natural term; And life, shorn of its venerable length, Even at its greatest space is a defeat, And dies in anger that it was a dupe; And, in its highest noon and wantonness, Is early frugal, like a beggar's child; Even in the hot pursuit of the best aims And prizes of ambition, checks its hand, Like Alpine cataracts frozen as they leaped, Chilled with a miserly comparison Of the toy's purchase with the length of life."
MUSKETAQUID,"Because I was content with these poor fields, Low, open meads, slender and sluggish streams, And found a home in haunts which others scorned, The partial wood-gods overpaid my love, And granted me the freedom of their state, And in their secret senate have prevailed With the dear, dangerous lords that rule our life, Made moon and planets parties to their bond, And through my rock-like, solitary wont Shot million rays of thought and tenderness.
For me, in showers, in sweeping showers, the Spring Visits the valley;—break away the clouds,— I bathe in the morn's soft and silvered air, And loiter willing by yon loitering stream.
Sparrows far off, and nearer, April's bird, Blue-coated,—flying before from tree to tree, Courageous sing a delicate overture To lead the tardy concert of the year.
Onward and nearer rides the sun of May; And wide around, the marriage of the plants Is sweetly solemnized.
Then flows amain The surge of summer's beauty; dell and crag, Hollow and lake, hillside and pine arcade, Are touched with genius.
Yonder ragged cliff Has thousand faces in a thousand hours.
Beneath low hills, in the broad interval Through which at will our Indian rivulet Winds mindful still of sannup and of squaw, Whose pipe and arrow oft the plough unburies, Here in pine houses built of new-fallen trees, Supplanters of the tribe, the farmers dwell.
Traveller, to thee, perchance, a tedious road, Or, it may be, a picture; to these men, The landscape is an armory of powers, Which, one by one, they know to draw and use.
They harness beast, bird, insect, to their work; They prove the virtues of each bed of rock, And, like the chemist 'mid his loaded jars, Draw from each stratum its adapted use To drug their crops or weapon their arts withal.
They turn the frost upon their chemic heap, They set the wind to winnow pulse and grain, They thank the spring-flood for its fertile slime, And, on cheap summit-levels of the snow, Slide with the sledge to inaccessible woods O'er meadows bottomless.
So, year by year, They fight the elements with elements (That one would say, meadow and forest walked, Transmuted in these men to rule their like), And by the order in the field disclose The order regnant in the yeoman's brain.
What these strong masters wrote at large in miles, I followed in small copy in my acre; For there's no rood has not a star above it; The cordial quality of pear or plum Ascends as gladly in a single tree As in broad orchards resonant with bees; And every atom poises for itself, And for the whole.
The gentle deities Showed me the lore of colors and of sounds, The innumerable tenements of beauty.
The miracle of generative force, Far-reaching concords of astronomy Felt in the plants and in the punctual birds; Better, the linked purpose of the whole, And, chiefest prize, found I true liberty In the glad home plain-dealing Nature gave.
The polite found me impolite; the great Would mortify me, but in vain; for still I am a willow of the wilderness, Loving the wind that bent me.
All my hurts My garden spade can heal.
A woodland walk, A quest of river-grapes, a mocking thrush, A wild-rose, or rock-loving columbine, Salve my worst wounds.
For thus the wood-gods murmured in my ear: 'Dost love our manners?
Canst thou silent lie?
Canst thou, thy pride forgot, like Nature pass Into the winter night's extinguished mood?
Canst thou shine now, then darkle, And being latent, feel thyself no less?
As, when the all-worshipped moon attracts the eye, The river, hill, stems, foliage are obscure, Yet envies none, none are unenviable.'"
"CONCORD, 1838","I reached the middle of the mount Up which the incarnate soul must climb, And paused for them, and looked around, With me who walked through space and time.
Five rosy boys with morning light Had leaped from one fair mother's arms, Fronted the sun with hope as bright, And greeted God with childhood's psalms.
Knows he who tills this lonely field To reap its scanty corn, What mystic fruit his acres yield At midnight and at morn?
In the long sunny afternoon The plain was full of ghosts; I wandered up, I wandered down, Beset by pensive hosts.
The winding Concord gleamed below, Pouring as wide a flood As when my brothers, long ago, Came with me to the wood.
But they are gone,—the holy ones Who trod with me this lovely vale; The strong, star-bright companions Are silent, low and pale.
My good, my noble, in their prime, Who made this world the feast it was Who learned with me the lore of time, Who loved this dwelling-place!
They took this valley for their toy, They played with it in every mood; A cell for prayer, a hall for joy,— They treated Nature as they would.
They colored the horizon round; Stars flamed and faded as they bade, All echoes hearkened for their sound,— They made the woodlands glad or mad.
I touch this flower of silken leaf, Which once our childhood knew; Its soft leaves wound me with a grief Whose balsam never grew.
Hearken to yon pine-warbler Singing aloft in the tree!
Hearest thou, O traveller, What he singeth to me?
Not unless God made sharp thine ear With sorrow such as mine, Out of that delicate lay could'st thou Its heavy tale divine. 'Go, lonely man,' it saith; 'They loved thee from their birth; Their hands were pure, and pure their faith,— There are no such hearts on earth. 'Ye drew one mother's milk, One chamber held ye all; A very tender history Did in your childhood fall. 'You cannot unlock your heart, The key is gone with them; The silent organ loudest chants The master's requiem.'"
THRENODY,"The South-wind brings Life, sunshine and desire, And on every mount and meadow Breathes aromatic fire; But over the dead he has no power, The lost, the lost, he cannot restore; And, looking over the hills, I mourn The darling who shall not return.
I see my empty house, I see my trees repair their boughs; And he, the wondrous child, Whose silver warble wild Outvalued every pulsing sound Within the air's cerulean round,— The hyacinthine boy, for whom Morn well might break and April bloom, The gracious boy, who did adorn The world whereinto he was born, And by his countenance repay The favor of the loving Day,— Has disappeared from the Day's eye; Far and wide she cannot find him; My hopes pursue, they cannot bind him.
Returned this day, the South-wind searches, And finds young pines and budding birches; But finds not the budding man; Nature, who lost, cannot remake him; Fate let him fall, Fate can't retake him; Nature, Fate, men, him seek in vain.
And whither now, my truant wise and sweet, O, whither tend thy feet?
I had the right, few days ago, Thy steps to watch, thy place to know: How have I forfeited the right?
Hast thou forgot me in a new delight?
I hearken for thy household cheer, O eloquent child!
Whose voice, an equal messenger, Conveyed thy meaning mild.
What though the pains and joys Whereof it spoke were toys Fitting his age and ken, Yet fairest dames and bearded men, Who heard the sweet request, So gentle, wise and grave, Bended with joy to his behest And let the world's affairs go by, A while to share his cordial game, Or mend his wicker wagon-frame, Still plotting how their hungry fear That winsome voice again might hear; For his lips could well pronounce Words that were persuasions.
Gentlest guardians marked serene His early hope, his liberal mien; Took counsel from his guiding eyes To make this wisdom earthly wise.
Ah, vainly do these eyes recall The school-march, each day's festival, When every morn my bosom glowed To watch the convoy on the road; The babe in willow wagon closed, With rolling eyes and face composed; With children forward and behind, Like Cupids studiously inclined; And he the chieftain paced beside, The centre of the troop allied, With sunny face of sweet repose, To guard the babe from fancied foes.
The little captain innocent Took the eye with him as he went; Each village senior paused to scan And speak the lovely caravan.
From the window I look out To mark thy beautiful parade, Stately marching in cap and coat To some tune by fairies played;— A music heard by thee alone To works as noble led thee on.
Now Love and Pride, alas! in vain, Up and down their glances strain.
The painted sled stands where it stood; The kennel by the corded wood; His gathered sticks to stanch the wall Of the snow-tower, when snow should fall; The ominous hole he dug in the sand, And childhood's castles built or planned; His daily haunts I well discern,— The poultry-yard, the shed, the barn,— And every inch of garden ground Paced by the blessed feet around, From the roadside to the brook Whereinto he loved to look.
Step the meek fowls where erst they ranged; The wintry garden lies unchanged; The brook into the stream runs on; But the deep-eyed boy is gone.
On that shaded day, Dark with more clouds than tempests are, When thou didst yield thy innocent breath In birdlike heavings unto death, Night came, and Nature had not thee; I said, 'We are mates in misery.' The morrow dawned with needless glow; Each snowbird chirped, each fowl must crow; Each tramper started; but the feet Of the most beautiful and sweet Of human youth had left the hill And garden,—they were bound and still.
There's not a sparrow or a wren, There's not a blade of autumn grain, Which the four seasons do not tend And tides of life and increase lend; And every chick of every bird, And weed and rock-moss is preferred.
O ostrich-like forgetfulness!
O loss of larger in the less!
Was there no star that could be sent, No watcher in the firmament, No angel from the countless host That loiters round the crystal coast, Could stoop to heal that only child, Nature's sweet marvel undefiled, And keep the blossom of the earth, Which all her harvests were not worth?
Not mine,—I never called thee mine, But Nature's heir,—if I repine, And seeing rashly torn and moved Not what I made, but what I loved, Grow early old with grief that thou Must to the wastes of Nature go,— 'T is because a general hope Was quenched, and all must doubt and grope.
For flattering planets seemed to say This child should ills of ages stay, By wondrous tongue, and guided pen, Bring the flown Muses back to men.
Perchance not he but Nature ailed, The world and not the infant failed.
It was not ripe yet to sustain A genius of so fine a strain, Who gazed upon the sun and moon As if he came unto his own, And, pregnant with his grander thought, Brought the old order into doubt.
His beauty once their beauty tried; They could not feed him, and he died, And wandered backward as in scorn, To wait an aeon to be born.
Ill day which made this beauty waste, Plight broken, this high face defaced!
Some went and came about the dead; And some in books of solace read; Some to their friends the tidings say; Some went to write, some went to pray; One tarried here, there hurried one; But their heart abode with none.
Covetous death bereaved us all, To aggrandize one funeral.
The eager fate which carried thee Took the largest part of me: For this losing is true dying; This is lordly man's down-lying, This his slow but sure reclining, Star by star his world resigning.
O child of paradise, Boy who made dear his father's home, In whose deep eyes Men read the welfare of the times to come, I am too much bereft.
The world dishonored thou hast left.
O truth's and nature's costly lie!
O trusted broken prophecy!
O richest fortune sourly crossed!
Born for the future, to the future lost!
The deep Heart answered, 'Weepest thou?
Worthier cause for passion wild If I had not taken the child.
And deemest thou as those who pore, With aged eyes, short way before,— Think'st Beauty vanished from the coast Of matter, and thy darling lost?
Taught he not thee—the man of eld, Whose eyes within his eyes beheld Heaven's numerous hierarchy span The mystic gulf from God to man?
To be alone wilt thou begin When worlds of lovers hem thee in?
To-morrow, when the masks shall fall That dizen Nature's carnival, The pure shall see by their own will, Which overflowing Love shall fill, 'T is not within the force of fate The fate-conjoined to separate.
But thou, my votary, weepest thou?
I gave thee sight—where is it now?
I taught thy heart beyond the reach Of ritual, bible, or of speech; Wrote in thy mind's transparent table, As far as the incommunicable; Taught thee each private sign to raise Lit by the supersolar blaze.
Past utterance, and past belief, And past the blasphemy of grief, The mysteries of Nature's heart; And though no Muse can these impart, Throb thine with Nature's throbbing breast, And all is clear from east to west. 'I came to thee as to a friend; Dearest, to thee I did not send Tutors, but a joyful eye, Innocence that matched the sky, Lovely locks, a form of wonder, Laughter rich as woodland thunder, That thou might'st entertain apart The richest flowering of all art: And, as the great all-loving Day Through smallest chambers takes its way, That thou might'st break thy daily bread With prophet, savior and head; That thou might'st cherish for thine own The riches of sweet Mary's Son, Boy-Rabbi, Israel's paragon.
And thoughtest thou such guest Would in thy hall take up his rest?
Would rushing life forget her laws, Fate's glowing revolution pause?
High omens ask diviner guess; Not to be conned to tediousness And know my higher gifts unbind The zone that girds the incarnate mind.
When the scanty shores are full With Thought's perilous, whirling pool; When frail Nature can no more, Then the Spirit strikes the hour: My servant Death, with solving rite, Pours finite into infinite.
Wilt thou freeze love's tidal flow, Whose streams through Nature circling go?
Nail the wild star to its track On the half-climbed zodiac?
Light is light which radiates, Blood is blood which circulates, Life is life which generates, And many-seeming life is one,— Wilt thou transfix and make it none?
Its onward force too starkly pent In figure, bone and lineament?
Wilt thou, uncalled, interrogate, Talker! the unreplying Fate?
Nor see the genius of the whole Ascendant in the private soul, Beckon it when to go and come, Self-announced its hour of doom?
Fair the soul's recess and shrine, Magic-built to last a season; Masterpiece of love benign, Fairer that expansive reason Whose omen 'tis, and sign.
Wilt thou not ope thy heart to know What rainbows teach, and sunsets show?
Verdict which accumulates From lengthening scroll of human fates, Voice of earth to earth returned, Prayers of saints that inly burned,— Saying, What is excellent, As God lives, is permanent; Hearts are dust, hearts' loves remain; Heart's love will meet thee again.
Revere the Maker; fetch thine eye Up to his style, and manners of the sky.
Not of adamant and gold Built he heaven stark and cold; No, but a nest of bending reeds, Flowering grass and scented weeds; Or like a traveller's fleeing tent, Or bow above the tempest bent; Built of tears and sacred flames, And virtue reaching to its aims; Built of furtherance and pursuing, Not of spent deeds, but of doing.
Silent rushes the swift Lord Through ruined systems still restored, Broadsowing, bleak and void to bless, Plants with worlds the wilderness; Waters with tears of ancient sorrow Apples of Eden ripe to-morrow.
House and tenant go to ground, Lost in God, in Godhead found.'"
"MONUMENT, JULY 4, 1837","By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April's breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood And fired the shot heard round the world.
The foe long since in silence slept; Alike the conqueror silent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has swept Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
On this green bank, by this soft stream, We set to-day a votive stone; That memory may their deed redeem, When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
Spirit, that made those heroes dare To die, and leave their children free, Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee."
MAY-DAY,"Daughter of Heaven and Earth, coy Spring, With sudden passion languishing, Teaching Barren moors to smile, Painting pictures mile on mile, Holds a cup with cowslip-wreaths, Whence a smokeless incense breathes.
The air is full of whistlings bland; What was that I heard Out of the hazy land?
Harp of the wind, or song of bird, Or vagrant booming of the air, Voice of a meteor lost in day?
Such tidings of the starry sphere Can this elastic air convey.
Or haply 'twas the cannonade Of the pent and darkened lake, Cooled by the pendent mountain's shade, Whose deeps, till beams of noonday break, Afflicted moan, and latest hold Even into May the iceberg cold.
Was it a squirrel's pettish bark, Or clarionet of jay? or hark Where yon wedged line the Nestor leads, Steering north with raucous cry Through tracts and provinces of sky, Every night alighting down In new landscapes of romance, Where darkling feed the clamorous clans By lonely lakes to men unknown.
Come the tumult whence it will, Voice of sport, or rush of wings, It is a sound, it is a token That the marble sleep is broken, And a change has passed on things.
When late I walked, in earlier days, All was stiff and stark; Knee-deep snows choked all the ways, In the sky no spark; Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods, Struggling through the drifted roads; The whited desert knew me not, Snow-ridges masked each darling spot; The summer dells, by genius haunted, One arctic moon had disenchanted.
All the sweet secrets therein hid By Fancy, ghastly spells undid.
Eldest mason, Frost, had piled Swift cathedrals in the wild; The piny hosts were sheeted ghosts In the star-lit minster aisled.
I found no joy: the icy wind Might rule the forest to his mind.
Who would freeze on frozen lakes?
Back to books and sheltered home, And wood-fire flickering on the walls, To hear, when, 'mid our talk and games, Without the baffled North-wind calls.
But soft! a sultry morning breaks; The ground-pines wash their rusty green, The maple-tops their crimson tint, On the soft path each track is seen, The girl's foot leaves its neater print.
The pebble loosened from the frost Asks of the urchin to be tost.
In flint and marble beats a heart, The kind Earth takes her children's part, The green lane is the school-boy's friend, Low leaves his quarrel apprehend, The fresh ground loves his top and ball, The air rings jocund to his call, The brimming brook invites a leap, He dives the hollow, climbs the steep.
The youth sees omens where he goes, And speaks all languages the rose, The wood-fly mocks with tiny voice The far halloo of human voice; The perfumed berry on the spray Smacks of faint memories far away.
A subtle chain of countless rings The next into the farthest brings, And, striving to be man, the worm Mounts through all the spires of form.
The caged linnet in the Spring Hearkens for the choral glee, When his fellows on the wing Migrate from the Southern Sea; When trellised grapes their flowers unmask, And the new-born tendrils twine, The old wine darkling in the cask Feels the bloom on the living vine, And bursts the hoops at hint of Spring: And so, perchance, in Adam's race, Of Eden's bower some dream-like trace Survived the Flight and swam the Flood, And wakes the wish in youngest blood To tread the forfeit Paradise, And feed once more the exile's eyes; And ever when the happy child In May beholds the blooming wild, And hears in heaven the bluebird sing, 'Onward,' he cries, 'your baskets bring,— In the next field is air more mild, And o'er yon hazy crest is Eden's balmier spring.' Not for a regiment's parade, Nor evil laws or rulers made, Blue Walden rolls its cannonade, But for a lofty sign Which the Zodiac threw, That the bondage-days are told.
And waters free as winds shall flow.
Lo! how all the tribes combine To rout the flying foe.
See, every patriot oak-leaf throws His elfin length upon the snows, Not idle, since the leaf all day Draws to the spot the solar ray, Ere sunset quarrying inches down, And halfway to the mosses brown; While the grass beneath the rime Has hints of the propitious time, And upward pries and perforates Through the cold slab a thousand gates, Till green lances peering through Bend happy in the welkin blue.
As we thaw frozen flesh with snow, So Spring will not her time forerun, Mix polar night with tropic glow, Nor cloy us with unshaded sun, Nor wanton skip with bacchic dance, But she has the temperance Of the gods, whereof she is one,— Masks her treasury of heat Under east winds crossed with sleet.
Plants and birds and humble creatures Well accept her rule austere; Titan-born, to hardy natures Cold is genial and dear.
As Southern wrath to Northern right Is but straw to anthracite; As in the day of sacrifice, When heroes piled the pyre, The dismal Massachusetts ice Burned more than others' fire, So Spring guards with surface cold The garnered heat of ages old.
Hers to sow the seed of bread, That man and all the kinds be fed; And, when the sunlight fills the hours, Dissolves the crust, displays the flowers.
Beneath the calm, within the light, A hid unruly appetite Of swifter life, a surer hope, Strains every sense to larger scope, Impatient to anticipate The halting steps of aged Fate.
Slow grows the palm, too slow the pearl: When Nature falters, fain would zeal Grasp the felloes of her wheel, And grasping give the orbs another whirl.
Turn swiftlier round, O tardy ball!
And sun this frozen side.
Bring hither back the robin's call, Bring back the tulip's pride.
Why chidest thou the tardy Spring?
The hardy bunting does not chide; The blackbirds make the maples ring With social cheer and jubilee; The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee, The robins know the melting snow; The sparrow meek, prophetic-eyed, Her nest beside the snow-drift weaves, Secure the osier yet will hide Her callow brood in mantling leaves,— And thou, by science all undone, Why only must thy reason fail To see the southing of the sun?
The world rolls round,—mistrust it not,— Befalls again what once befell; All things return, both sphere and mote, And I shall hear my bluebird's note, And dream the dream of Auburn dell.
April cold with dropping rain Willows and lilacs brings again, The whistle of returning birds, And trumpet-lowing of the herds.
The scarlet maple-keys betray What potent blood hath modest May, What fiery force the earth renews, The wealth of forms, the flush of hues; What joy in rosy waves outpoured Flows from the heart of Love, the Lord.
Hither rolls the storm of heat; I feel its finer billows beat Like a sea which me infolds; Heat with viewless fingers moulds, Swells, and mellows, and matures, Paints, and flavors, and allures, Bird and brier inly warms, Still enriches and transforms, Gives the reed and lily length, Adds to oak and oxen strength, Transforming what it doth infold, Life out of death, new out of old, Painting fawns' and leopards' fells, Seethes the gulf-encrimsoning shells, Fires gardens with a joyful blaze Of tulips, in the morning's rays.
The dead log touched bursts into leaf, The wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.
What god is this imperial Heat, Earth's prime secret, sculpture's seat?
Doth it bear hidden in its heart Water-line patterns of all art?
Is it Daedalus? is it Love?
Or walks in mask almighty Jove, And drops from Power's redundant horn All seeds of beauty to be born?
Where shall we keep the holiday, And duly greet the entering May?
Too strait and low our cottage doors, And all unmeet our carpet floors; Nor spacious court, nor monarch's hall, Suffice to hold the festival.
Up and away! where haughty woods Front the liberated floods: We will climb the broad-backed hills, Hear the uproar of their joy; We will mark the leaps and gleams Of the new-delivered streams, And the murmuring rivers of sap Mount in the pipes of the trees, Giddy with day, to the topmost spire, Which for a spike of tender green Bartered its powdery cap; And the colors of joy in the bird, And the love in its carol heard, Frog and lizard in holiday coats, And turtle brave in his golden spots; While cheerful cries of crag and plain Reply to the thunder of river and main.
As poured the flood of the ancient sea Spilling over mountain chains, Bending forests as bends the sedge, Faster flowing o'er the plains,— A world-wide wave with a foaming edge That rims the running silver sheet,— So pours the deluge of the heat Broad northward o'er the land, Painting artless paradises, Drugging herbs with Syrian spices, Fanning secret fires which glow In columbine and clover-blow, Climbing the northern zones, Where a thousand pallid towns Lie like cockles by the main, Or tented armies on a plain.
The million-handed sculptor moulds Quaintest bud and blossom folds, The million-handed painter pours Opal hues and purple dye; Azaleas flush the island floors, And the tints of heaven reply.
Wreaths for the May! for happy Spring To-day shall all her dowry bring, The love of kind, the joy, the grace, Hymen of element and race, Knowing well to celebrate With song and hue and star and state, With tender light and youthful cheer, The spousals of the new-born year.
Spring is strong and virtuous, Broad-sowing, cheerful, plenteous, Quickening underneath the mould Grains beyond the price of gold.
So deep and large her bounties are, That one broad, long midsummer day Shall to the planet overpay The ravage of a year of war.
Drug the cup, thou butler sweet, And send the nectar round; The feet that slid so long on sleet Are glad to feel the ground.
Fill and saturate each kind With good according to its mind, Fill each kind and saturate With good agreeing with its fate, And soft perfection of its plan— Willow and violet, maiden and man.
The bitter-sweet, the haunting air Creepeth, bloweth everywhere; It preys on all, all prey on it.
Blooms in beauty, thinks in wit, Stings the strong with enterprise, Makes travellers long for Indian skies, And where it comes this courier fleet Fans in all hearts expectance sweet, As if to-morrow should redeem The vanished rose of evening's dream.
By houses lies a fresher green, On men and maids a ruddier mien, As if Time brought a new relay Of shining virgins every May, And Summer came to ripen maids To a beauty that not fades.
I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth, Stepping daily onward north To greet staid ancient cavaliers Filing single in stately train.
And who, and who are the travellers?
They were Night and Day, and Day and Night, Pilgrims wight with step forthright.
I saw the Days deformed and low, Short and bent by cold and snow; The merry Spring threw wreaths on them, Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell; Many a flower and many a gem, They were refreshed by the smell, They shook the snow from hats and shoon, They put their April raiment on; And those eternal forms, Unhurt by a thousand storms, Shot up to the height of the sky again, And danced as merrily as young men.
I saw them mask their awful glance Sidewise meek in gossamer lids; And to speak my thought if none forbids It was as if the eternal gods, Tired of their starry periods, Hid their majesty in cloth Woven of tulips and painted moth.
On carpets green the maskers march Below May's well-appointed arch, Each star, each god; each grace amain, Every joy and virtue speed, Marching duly in her train, And fainting Nature at her need Is made whole again. 'Twas the vintage-day of field and wood, When magic wine for bards is brewed; Every tree and stem and chink Gushed with syrup to the brink.
The air stole into the streets of towns, Refreshed the wise, reformed the clowns, And betrayed the fund of joy To the high-school and medalled boy: On from hall to chamber ran, From youth to maid, from boy to man, To babes, and to old eyes as well. 'Once more,' the old man cried, 'ye clouds, Airy turrets purple-piled, Which once my infancy beguiled, Beguile me with the wonted spell.
I know ye skilful to convoy The total freight of hope and joy Into rude and homely nooks, Shed mocking lustres on shelf of books, On farmer's byre, on pasture rude, And stony pathway to the wood.
I care not if the pomps you show Be what they soothfast appear, Or if yon realms in sunset glow Be bubbles of the atmosphere.
And if it be to you allowed To fool me with a shining cloud, So only new griefs are consoled By new delights, as old by old, Frankly I will be your guest, Count your change and cheer the best.
The world hath overmuch of pain,— If Nature give me joy again, Of such deceit I'll not complain.' Ah! well I mind the calendar, Faithful through a thousand years, Of the painted race of flowers, Exact to days, exact to hours, Counted on the spacious dial Yon broidered zodiac girds.
I know the trusty almanac Of the punctual coming-back, On their due days, of the birds.
I marked them yestermorn, A flock of finches darting Beneath the crystal arch, Piping, as they flew, a march,— Belike the one they used in parting Last year from yon oak or larch; Dusky sparrows in a crowd, Diving, darting northward free, Suddenly betook them all, Every one to his hole in the wall, Or to his niche in the apple-tree.
I greet with joy the choral trains Fresh from palms and Cuba's canes.
Best gems of Nature's cabinet, With dews of tropic morning wet, Beloved of children, bards and Spring, O birds, your perfect virtues bring, Your song, your forms, your rhythmic flight, Your manners for the heart's delight, Nestle in hedge, or barn, or roof, Here weave your chamber weather-proof, Forgive our harms, and condescend To man, as to a lubber friend, And, generous, teach his awkward race Courage and probity and grace!
Poets praise that hidden wine Hid in milk we drew At the barrier of Time, When our life was new.
We had eaten fairy fruit, We were quick from head to foot, All the forms we looked on shone As with diamond dews thereon.
What cared we for costly joys, The Museum's far-fetched toys?
Gleam of sunshine on the wall Poured a deeper cheer than all The revels of the Carnival.
We a pine-grove did prefer To a marble theatre, Could with gods on mallows dine, Nor cared for spices or for wine.
Wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned.
Arch on arch, the grimmest land; Whittle of a woodland bird Made the pulses dance, Note of horn in valleys heard Filled the region with romance.
None can tell how sweet, How virtuous, the morning air; Every accent vibrates well; Not alone the wood-bird's call, Or shouting boys that chase their ball, Pass the height of minstrel skill, But the ploughman's thoughtless cry, Lowing oxen, sheep that bleat, And the joiner's hammer-beat, Softened are above their will, Take tones from groves they wandered through Or flutes which passing angels blew.
All grating discords melt, No dissonant note is dealt, And though thy voice be shrill Like rasping file on steel, Such is the temper of the air, Echo waits with art and care, And will the faults of song repair.
So by remote Superior Lake, And by resounding Mackinac, When northern storms the forest shake, And billows on the long beach break, The artful Air will separate Note by note all sounds that grate, Smothering in her ample breast All but godlike words, Reporting to the happy ear Only purified accords.
Strangely wrought from barking waves, Soft music daunts the Indian braves,— Convent-chanting which the child Hears pealing from the panther's cave And the impenetrable wild.
Soft on the South-wind sleeps the haze: So on thy broad mystic van Lie the opal-colored days, And waft the miracle to man.
Soothsayer of the eldest gods, Repairer of what harms betide, Revealer of the inmost powers Prometheus proffered, Jove denied; Disclosing treasures more than true, Or in what far to-morrow due; Speaking by the tongues of flowers, By the ten-tongued laurel speaking, Singing by the oriole songs, Heart of bird the man's heart seeking; Whispering hints of treasure hid Under Morn's unlifted lid, Islands looming just beyond The dim horizon's utmost bound;— Who can, like thee, our rags upbraid, Or taunt us with our hope decayed?
Or who like thee persuade, Making the splendor of the air, The morn and sparkling dew, a snare?
Or who resent Thy genius, wiles and blandishment?
There is no orator prevails To beckon or persuade Like thee the youth or maid: Thy birds, thy songs, thy brooks, thy gales, Thy blooms, thy kinds, Thy echoes in the wilderness, Soothe pain, and age, and love's distress, Fire fainting will, and build heroic minds.
For thou, O Spring! canst renovate All that high God did first create.
Be still his arm and architect, Rebuild the ruin, mend defect; Chemist to vamp old worlds with new, Coat sea and sky with heavenlier blue, New tint the plumage of the birds, And slough decay from grazing herds, Sweep ruins from the scarped mountain, Cleanse the torrent at the fountain, Purge alpine air by towns defiled, Bring to fair mother fairer child, Not less renew the heart and brain, Scatter the sloth, wash out the stain, Make the aged eye sun-clear, To parting soul bring grandeur near.
Under gentle types, my Spring Masks the might of Nature's king, An energy that searches thorough From Chaos to the dawning morrow; Into all our human plight, The soul's pilgrimage and flight; In city or in solitude, Step by step, lifts bad to good, Without halting, without rest, Lifting Better up to Best; Planting seeds of knowledge pure, Through earth to ripen, through heaven endure."
"DEDICATED TO MY FELLOW TRAVELLERS IN AUGUST, 1858","Wise and polite,—and if I drew Their several portraits, you would own Chaucer had no such worthy crew, Nor Boccace in Decameron.
We crossed Champlain to Keeseville with our friends, Thence, in strong country carts, rode up the forks Of the Ausable stream, intent to reach The Adirondac lakes.
At Martin's Beach We chose our boats; each man a boat and guide,— Ten men, ten guides, our company all told.
Next morn, we swept with oars the Saranac, With skies of benediction, to Round Lake, Where all the sacred mountains drew around us, Taháwus, Seaward, MacIntyre, Baldhead, And other Titans without muse or name.
Pleased with these grand companions, we glide on, Instead of flowers, crowned with a wreath of hills.
We made our distance wider, boat from boat, As each would hear the oracle alone.
By the bright morn the gay flotilla slid Through files of flags that gleamed like bayonets, Through gold-moth-haunted beds of pickerel-flower, Through scented banks of lilies white and gold, Where the deer feeds at night, the teal by day, On through the Upper Saranac, and up Père Raquette stream, to a small tortuous pass Winding through grassy shallows in and out, Two creeping miles of rushes, pads and sponge, To Follansbee Water and the Lake of Loons.
Northward the length of Follansbee we rowed, Under low mountains, whose unbroken ridge Ponderous with beechen forest sloped the shore.
A pause and council: then, where near the head Due east a bay makes inward to the land Between two rocky arms, we climb the bank, And in the twilight of the forest noon Wield the first axe these echoes ever heard.
We cut young trees to make our poles and thwarts, Barked the white spruce to weatherfend the roof, Then struck a light and kindled the camp-fire.
The wood was sovran with centennial trees,— Oak, cedar, maple, poplar, beech and fir, Linden and spruce.
In strict society Three conifers, white, pitch and Norway pine, Five-leaved, three-leaved and two-leaved, grew thereby, Our patron pine was fifteen feet in girth, The maple eight, beneath its shapely tower. 'Welcome!' the wood-god murmured through the leaves,— 'Welcome, though late, unknowing, yet known to me.' Evening drew on; stars peeped through maple-boughs, Which o'erhung, like a cloud, our camping fire.
Decayed millennial trunks, like moonlight flecks, Lit with phosphoric crumbs the forest floor.
Ten scholars, wonted to lie warm and soft In well-hung chambers daintily bestowed, Lie here on hemlock-boughs, like Sacs and Sioux, And greet unanimous the joyful change.
So fast will Nature acclimate her sons, Though late returning to her pristine ways.
Off soundings, seamen do not suffer cold; And, in the forest, delicate clerks, unbrowned, Sleep on the fragrant brush, as on down-beds.
Up with the dawn, they fancied the light air That circled freshly in their forest dress Made them to boys again.
Happier that they Slipped off their pack of duties, leagues behind, At the first mounting of the giant stairs.
No placard on these rocks warned to the polls, No door-bell heralded a visitor, No courier waits, no letter came or went, Nothing was ploughed, or reaped, or bought, or sold; The frost might glitter, it would blight no crop, The falling rain will spoil no holiday.
We were made freemen of the forest laws, All dressed, like Nature, fit for her own ends, Essaying nothing she cannot perform.
In Adirondac lakes At morn or noon, the guide rows bareheaded: Shoes, flannel shirt, and kersey trousers make His brief toilette: at night, or in the rain, He dons a surcoat which he doffs at morn: A paddle in the right hand, or an oar, And in the left, a gun, his needful arms.
By turns we praised the stature of our guides, Their rival strength and suppleness, their skill To row, to swim, to shoot, to build a camp, To climb a lofty stem, clean without boughs Full fifty feet, and bring the eaglet down: Temper to face wolf, bear, or catamount, And wit to trap or take him in his lair.
Sound, ruddy men, frolic and innocent, In winter, lumberers; in summer, guides; Their sinewy arms pull at the oar untired Three times ten thousand strokes, from morn to eve.
Look to yourselves, ye polished gentlemen!
No city airs or arts pass current here.
Your rank is all reversed; let men or cloth Bow to the stalwart churls in overalls: They are the doctors of the wilderness, And we the low-prized laymen.
In sooth, red flannel is a saucy test Which few can put on with impunity.
What make you, master, fumbling at the oar?
Will you catch crabs?
Truth tries pretension here.
The sallow knows the basket-maker's thumb; The oar, the guide's.
Dare you accept the tasks He shall impose, to find a spring, trap foxes, Tell the sun's time, determine the true north, Or stumbling on through vast self-similar woods To thread by night the nearest way to camp?
Ask you, how went the hours?
All day we swept the lake, searched every cove, North from Camp Maple, south to Osprey Bay, Watching when the loud dogs should drive in deer, Or whipping its rough surface for a trout; Or, bathers, diving from the rock at noon; Challenging Echo by our guns and cries; Or listening to the laughter of the loon; Or, in the evening twilight's latest red, Beholding the procession of the pines; Or, later yet, beneath a lighted jack, In the boat's bows, a silent night-hunter Stealing with paddle to the feeding-grounds Of the red deer, to aim at a square mist.
Hark to that muffled roar! a tree in the woods Is fallen: but hush! it has not scared the buck Who stands astonished at the meteor light, Then turns to bound away,—is it too late?
Our heroes tried their rifles at a mark, Six rods, sixteen, twenty, or forty-five; Sometimes their wits at sally and retort, With laughter sudden as the crack of rifle; Or parties scaled the near acclivities Competing seekers of a rumored lake, Whose unauthenticated waves we named Lake Probability,—our carbuncle, Long sought, not found.
Two Doctors in the camp Dissected the slain deer, weighed the trout's brain, Captured the lizard, salamander, shrew, Crab, mice, snail, dragon-fly, minnow and moth; Insatiate skill in water or in air Waved the scoop-net, and nothing came amiss; The while, one leaden got of alcohol Gave an impartial tomb to all the kinds.
Not less the ambitious botanist sought plants, Orchis and gentian, fern and long whip-scirpus, Rosy polygonum, lake-margin's pride, Hypnum and hydnum, mushroom, sponge and moss, Or harebell nodding in the gorge of falls.
Above, the eagle flew, the osprey screamed, The raven croaked, owls hooted, the woodpecker Loud hammered, and the heron rose in the swamp.
As water poured through hollows of the hills To feed this wealth of lakes and rivulets, So Nature shed all beauty lavishly From her redundant horn.
Lords of this realm, Bounded by dawn and sunset, and the day Rounded by hours where each outdid the last In miracles of pomp, we must be proud, As if associates of the sylvan gods.
We seemed the dwellers of the zodiac, So pure the Alpine element we breathed, So light, so lofty pictures came and went.
We trode on air, contemned the distant town, Its timorous ways, big trifles, and we planned That we should build, hard-by, a spacious lodge And how we should come hither with our sons, Hereafter,—willing they, and more adroit.
Hard fare, hard bed and comic misery,— The midge, the blue-fly and the mosquito Painted our necks, hands, ankles, with red bands: But, on the second day, we heed them not, Nay, we saluted them Auxiliaries, Whom earlier we had chid with spiteful names.
For who defends our leafy tabernacle From bold intrusion of the travelling crowd,— Who but the midge, mosquito and the fly, Which past endurance sting the tender cit, But which we learn to scatter with a smudge, Or baffle by a veil, or slight by scorn?
Our foaming ale we drank from hunters' pans, Ale, and a sup of wine.
Our steward gave Venison and trout, potatoes, beans, wheat-bread; All ate like abbots, and, if any missed Their wonted convenance, cheerly hid the loss With hunters' appetite and peals of mirth.
And Stillman, our guides' guide, and Commodore, Crusoe, Crusader, Pius Aeneas, said aloud, ""Chronic dyspepsia never came from eating Food indigestible"":—then murmured some, Others applauded him who spoke the truth.
Nor doubt but visitings of graver thought Checked in these souls the turbulent heyday 'Mid all the hints and glories of the home.
For who can tell what sudden privacies Were sought and found, amid the hue and cry Of scholars furloughed from their tasks and let Into this Oreads' fended Paradise, As chapels in the city's thoroughfares, Whither gaunt Labor slips to wipe his brow And meditate a moment on Heaven's rest.
Judge with what sweet surprises Nature spoke To each apart, lifting her lovely shows To spiritual lessons pointed home, And as through dreams in watches of the night, So through all creatures in their form and ways Some mystic hint accosts the vigilant, Not clearly voiced, but waking a new sense Inviting to new knowledge, one with old.
Hark to that petulant chirp! what ails the warbler?
Mark his capricious ways to draw the eye.
Now soar again.
What wilt thou, restless bird, Seeking in that chaste blue a bluer light, Thirsting in that pure for a purer sky?
And presently the sky is changed; O world!
What pictures and what harmonies are thine!
The clouds are rich and dark, the air serene, So like the soul of me, what if 't were me?
A melancholy better than all mirth.
Comes the sweet sadness at the retrospect, Or at the foresight of obscurer years?
Like yon slow-sailing cloudy promontory Whereon the purple iris dwells in beauty Superior to all its gaudy skirts.
And, that no day of life may lack romance, The spiritual stars rise nightly, shedding down A private beam into each several heart.
Daily the bending skies solicit man, The seasons chariot him from this exile, The rainbow hours bedeck his glowing chair, The storm-winds urge the heavy weeks along, Suns haste to set, that so remoter lights Beckon the wanderer to his vaster home.
With a vermilion pencil mark the day When of our little fleet three cruising skiffs Entering Big Tupper, bound for the foaming Falls Of loud Bog River, suddenly confront Two of our mates returning with swift oars.
One held a printed journal waving high Caught from a late-arriving traveller, Big with great news, and shouted the report For which the world had waited, now firm fact, Of the wire-cable laid beneath the sea, And landed on our coast, and pulsating With ductile fire.
Loud, exulting cries From boat to boat, and to the echoes round, Greet the glad miracle.
Thought's new-found path Shall supplement henceforth all trodden ways, Match God's equator with a zone of art, And lift man's public action to a height Worthy the enormous cloud of witnesses, When linkèd hemispheres attest his deed.
We have few moments in the longest life Of such delight and wonder as there grew,— Nor yet unsuited to that solitude: A burst of joy, as if we told the fact To ears intelligent; as if gray rock And cedar grove and cliff and lake should know This feat of wit, this triumph of mankind; As if we men were talking in a vein Of sympathy so large, that ours was theirs, And a prime end of the most subtle element Were fairly reached at last.
Wake, echoing caves!
Bend nearer, faint day-moon!
Yon thundertops, Let them hear well! 'tis theirs as much as ours.
A spasm throbbing through the pedestals Of Alp and Andes, isle and continent, Urging astonished Chaos with a thrill To be a brain, or serve the brain of man.
The lightning has run masterless too long; He must to school and learn his verb and noun And teach his nimbleness to earn his wage, Spelling with guided tongue man's messages Shot through the weltering pit of the salt sea.
And yet I marked, even in the manly joy Of our great-hearted Doctor in his boat (Perchance I erred), a shade of discontent; Or was it for mankind a generous shame, As of a luck not quite legitimate, Since fortune snatched from wit the lion's part?
Was it a college pique of town and gown, As one within whose memory it burned That not academicians, but some lout, Found ten years since the Californian gold?
And now, again, a hungry company Of traders, led by corporate sons of trade, Perversely borrowing from the shop the tools Of science, not from the philosophers, Had won the brightest laurel of all time. 'Twas always thus, and will be; hand and head Are ever rivals: but, though this be swift, The other slow,—this the Prometheus, And that the Jove,—yet, howsoever hid, It was from Jove the other stole his fire, And, without Jove, the good had never been.
It is not Iroquois or cannibals, But ever the free race with front sublime, And these instructed by their wisest too, Who do the feat, and lift humanity.
Let not him mourn who best entitled was, Nay, mourn not one: let him exult, Yea, plant the tree that bears best apples, plant, And water it with wine, nor watch askance Whether thy sons or strangers eat the fruit: Enough that mankind eat and are refreshed.
We flee away from cities, but we bring The best of cities with us, these learned classifiers, Men knowing what they seek, armed eyes of experts.
We praise the guide, we praise the forest life: But will we sacrifice our dear-bought lore Of books and arts and trained experiment, Or count the Sioux a match for Agassiz?
O no, not we!
Witness the shout that shook Wild Tupper Lake; witness the mute all-hail The joyful traveller gives, when on the verge Of craggy Indian wilderness he hears From a log cabin stream Beethoven's notes On the piano, played with master's hand. 'Well done!' he cries; 'the bear is kept at bay, The lynx, the rattlesnake, the flood, the fire; All the fierce enemies, ague, hunger, cold, This thin spruce roof, this clayed log-wall, This wild plantation will suffice to chase.
Now speed the gay celerities of art, What in the desert was impossible Within four walls is possible again,— Culture and libraries, mysteries of skill, Traditioned fame of masters, eager strife Of keen competing youths, joined or alone To outdo each other and extort applause.
Mind wakes a new-born giant from her sleep.
Twirl the old wheels!
Time takes fresh start again, On for a thousand years of genius more.' The holidays were fruitful, but must end; One August evening had a cooler breath; Into each mind intruding duties crept; Under the cinders burned the fires of home; Nay, letters found us in our paradise: So in the gladness of the new event We struck our camp and left the happy hills.
The fortunate star that rose on us sank not; The prodigal sunshine rested on the land, The rivers gambolled onward to the sea, And Nature, the inscrutable and mute, Permitted on her infinite repose Almost a smile to steal to cheer her sons, As if one riddle of the Sphinx were guessed."
BRAHMA,"If the red slayer think he slays, Or if the slain think he is slain, They know not well the subtle ways I keep, and pass, and turn again.
Far or forgot to me is near; Shadow and sunlight are the same; The vanished gods to me appear; And one to me are shame and fame.
They reckon ill who leave me out; When me they fly, I am the wings; I am the doubter and the doubt, And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.
The strong gods pine for my abode, And pine in vain the sacred Seven; But thou, meek lover of the good!
Find me, and turn thy back on heaven."
I. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD,"April is the cruellest month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter kept us warm, covering Earth in forgetful snow, feeding A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s, My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled, And I was frightened.
He said, Marie, Marie, hold on tight.
And down we went.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.
What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow Out of this stony rubbish?
Son of man, You cannot say, or guess, for you know only A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, And the dry stone no sound of water.
Only There is shadow under this red rock, (Come in under the shadow of this red rock), And I will show you something different from either Your shadow at morning striding behind you Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; I will show you fear in a handful of dust.
Frisch weht der Wind Der Heimat zu Mein Irisch Kind, Wo weilest du? “You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; “They called me the hyacinth girl.” —Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, Looking into the heart of light, the silence.
Oed’ und leer das Meer.
Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, Had a bad cold, nevertheless Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe, With a wicked pack of cards.
Here, said she, Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor, (Those are pearls that were his eyes.
Look!) Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, The lady of situations.
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card, Which is blank, is something he carries on his back, Which I am forbidden to see.
I do not find The Hanged Man.
Fear death by water.
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
Thank you.
If you see dear Mrs.
Equitone, Tell her I bring the horoscope myself: One must be so careful these days.
Unreal City, Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, I had not thought death had undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying “Stetson! “You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! “That corpse you planted last year in your garden, “Has it begun to sprout?
Will it bloom this year? “Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? “Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men, “Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again! “You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”"
II. A GAME OF CHESS,"The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, Glowed on the marble, where the glass Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines From which a golden Cupidon peeped out (Another hid his eyes behind his wing) Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra Reflecting light upon the table as The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, From satin cases poured in rich profusion.
In vials of ivory and coloured glass Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air That freshened from the window, these ascended In fattening the prolonged candle-flames, Flung their smoke into the laquearia, Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.
Huge sea-wood fed with copper Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, In which sad light a carvèd dolphin swam.
Above the antique mantel was displayed As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale Filled all the desert with inviolable voice And still she cried, and still the world pursues, “Jug Jug” to dirty ears.
And other withered stumps of time Were told upon the walls; staring forms Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.
Footsteps shuffled on the stair.
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair Spread out in fiery points Glowed into words, then would be savagely still. “My nerves are bad to-night.
Yes, bad.
Stay with me. “Speak to me.
Why do you never speak.
Speak. “What are you thinking of?
What thinking?
What? “I never know what you are thinking.
Think.” I think we are in rats’ alley Where the dead men lost their bones. “What is that noise?” The wind under the door. “What is that noise now?
What is the wind doing?” Nothing again nothing. “Do “You know nothing?
Do you see nothing?
Do you remember “Nothing?” I remember Those are pearls that were his eyes. “Are you alive, or not?
Is there nothing in your head?” But O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag— It’s so elegant So intelligent “What shall I do now?
What shall I do?” I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street “With my hair down, so.
What shall we do tomorrow? “What shall we ever do?” The hot water at ten.
And if it rains, a closed car at four.
And we shall play a game of chess, Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.
When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said— I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,"
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME,"Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you To get yourself some teeth.
He did, I was there.
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set, He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert, He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time, And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.
Oh is there, she said.
Something o’ that, I said.
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look."
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME,"If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.
Others can pick and choose if you can’t.
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique. (And her only thirty-one.) I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face, It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. (She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.) The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same.
You are a proper fool, I said.
Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said, What you get married for if you don’t want children?"
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME,"Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon, And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—"
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME,"Goonight Bill.
Goonight Lou.
Goonight May.

Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night."
III. THE FIRE SERMON,"The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf Clutch and sink into the wet bank.
The wind Crosses the brown land, unheard.
The nymphs are departed.
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends Or other testimony of summer nights.
The nymphs are departed.
And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors; Departed, have left no addresses.
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song, Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
But at my back in a cold blast I hear The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
A rat crept softly through the vegetation Dragging its slimy belly on the bank While I was fishing in the dull canal On a winter evening round behind the gashouse Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck And on the king my father’s death before him.
White bodies naked on the low damp ground And bones cast in a little low dry garret, Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.
But at my back from time to time I hear The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs.
Porter in the spring.
O the moon shone bright on Mrs.
Porter And on her daughter They wash their feet in soda water Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!
Twit twit twit Jug jug jug jug jug jug So rudely forc’d.
Tereu Unreal City Under the brown fog of a winter noon Mr.
Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants C.i.f.
London: documents at sight, Asked me in demotic French To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.
At the violet hour, when the eyes and back Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits Like a taxi throbbing waiting, I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
Out of the window perilously spread Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays, On the divan are piled (at night her bed) Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest— I too awaited the expected guest.
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives, A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare, One of the low on whom assurance sits As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.
The time is now propitious, as he guesses, The meal is ended, she is bored and tired, Endeavours to engage her in caresses Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once; Exploring hands encounter no defence; His vanity requires no response, And makes a welcome of indifference. (And I Tiresias have foresuffered all Enacted on this same divan or bed; I who have sat by Thebes below the wall And walked among the lowest of the dead.) Bestows one final patronising kiss, And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .
She turns and looks a moment in the glass, Hardly aware of her departed lover; Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass: “Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.” When lovely woman stoops to folly and Paces about her room again, alone, She smooths her hair with automatic hand, And puts a record on the gramophone. “This music crept by me upon the waters” And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.
O City city, I can sometimes hear Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street, The pleasant whining of a mandoline And a clatter and a chatter from within Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls Of Magnus Martyr hold Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.
The river sweats Oil and tar The barges drift With the turning tide Red sails Wide To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
The barges wash Drifting logs Down Greenwich reach Past the Isle of Dogs.

IV. DEATH BY WATER,"Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss.
A current under sea Picked his bones in whispers.
As he rose and fell He passed the stages of his age and youth Entering the whirlpool.
Gentile or Jew O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you."
V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID,"After the torchlight red on sweaty faces After the frosty silence in the gardens After the agony in stony places The shouting and the crying Prison and palace and reverberation Of thunder of spring over distant mountains He who was living is now dead We who were living are now dying With a little patience Here is no water but only rock Rock and no water and the sandy road The road winding above among the mountains Which are mountains of rock without water If there were water we should stop and drink Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand If there were only water amongst the rock Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit There is not even silence in the mountains But dry sterile thunder without rain There is not even solitude in the mountains But red sullen faces sneer and snarl From doors of mudcracked houses If there were water And no rock If there were rock And also water And water A spring A pool among the rock If there were the sound of water only Not the cicada And dry grass singing But sound of water over a rock Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop But there is no water Who is the third who walks always beside you?
When I count, there are only you and I together But when I look ahead up the white road There is always another one walking beside you Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded I do not know whether a man or a woman —But who is that on the other side of you?
What is that sound high in the air Murmur of maternal lamentation Who are those hooded hordes swarming Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth Ringed by the flat horizon only What is the city over the mountains Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air Falling towers Jerusalem Athens Alexandria Vienna London Unreal A woman drew her long black hair out tight And fiddled whisper music on those strings And bats with baby faces in the violet light Whistled, and beat their wings And crawled head downward down a blackened wall And upside down in air were towers Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.
In this decayed hole among the mountains In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.
It has no windows, and the door swings, Dry bones can harm no one.
Only a cock stood on the rooftree Co co rico co co rico In a flash of lightning.
Then a damp gust Bringing rain Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves Waited for rain, while the black clouds Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.
Then spoke the thunder"

NOTES ON “THE WASTE LAND”,"Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L.
Weston’s book on the Grail legend: From Ritual to Romance (Macmillan, Cambridge) Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston’s book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble.
To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean The Golden Bough; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris.
Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies."

I am not familiar with the exact constitution of the Tarot pack of cards, from which I have obviously departed to suit my own convenience.
The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional pack, fits my purpose in two ways: because he is associated in my mind with the Hanged God of Frazer, and because I associate him with the hooded figure in the passage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V.
The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant appear later; also the “crowds of people,” and Death by Water is executed in Part IV.
The Man with Three Staves (an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite arbitrarily, with the Fisher King himself. .

PEDANTIC LITERALIST,"Prince Rupert’s drop, paper muslin ghost, white torch—“with pow’r to say unkind things with kindness, and the most irritating things in the midst of love and tears,” you invite destruction.
You are like the meditative man with the perfunctory heart; its carved cordiality ran to and fro at first, like an inlaid and roy’l immutable production; then afterward “neglected to be painful” and “deluded him with loitering formality, doing its duty as if it did it not,” presenting an obstruction to the motive that it served.
What stood erect in you, has withered.
A little “palm-tree of turned wood” informs your once spontaneous core in its immutable reduction. [Pg 6]"
TO A STEAM ROLLER,"The illustration is nothing to you without the application.
You lack half wit.
You crush all the particles down into close conformity, and then walk back and forth on them.
Sparkling chips of rock are crushed down to the level of the parent block.
Were not “impersonal judgment in æsthetic matters, a metaphysical impossibility,” you might fairly achieve it.
As for butterflies, I can hardly conceive of one’s attending upon you, but to question the congruence of the complement is vain, if it exists."
PROGRESS IS TO FLIGHT,"With an elephant to ride upon—“with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,” she shall outdistance calamity anywhere she goes.
Speed is not in her mind inseparable from carpets.
Locomotion arose in the shape of an elephant, she clambered up and chose to travel laboriously.
So far as magic carpets are concerned, she knows that although the semblance of speed may attach to scarecrows of æsthetic procedure, the substance of it is embodied in such of those tough-grained animals as have outstripped man’s whim to suppose them ephemera, and have earned that fruit of their ability to endure blows, which dubs them prosaic necessities—not curios. [Pg 7]"
THOSE VARIOUS SCALPELS,"Those various sounds consistently indistinct, like intermingled echoes struck from thin glass successively at random—the inflection disguised: your hair, the tails of two fighting-cocks head to head in stone—like sculptured scimitars re- peating the curve of your ears in reverse order: your eyes, flowers of ice and snow sown by tearing winds on the cordage of disabled ships: your raised hand an ambiguous signature: your cheeks, those rosettes of blood on the stone floors of French châteaux, with regard to which guides are so affirmative: your other hand a bundle of lances all alike, partly hid by emeralds from Persia and the fractional magnificence of Florentine goldwork—a collection of half a dozen little objects made fine with enamel in gray, yellow, and dragonfly blue: a lemon, a pear and three bunches of grapes, tied with silver: your dress, a magnificent square cathedral of uniform and at the same time, diverse appearance—a species of vertical vineyard rustling in the storm of conventional opinion.
Are they weapons or scalpels?
Whetted to brilliance by the hard majesty of that sophistication which is su- perior to opportunity, these things are rich instruments with which to experiment but surgery is not tentative: why dissect destiny with instruments which are more highly specialized than the tissues of destiny itself? [Pg 8]"
"FEED ME, ALSO, RIVER GOD,","lest by diminished vitality and abated vigilance, I become food for crocodiles—for that quicksand of gluttony which is legion.
It is there—close at hand— on either side of me.
You remember the Israelites who said in pride and stoutness of heart: “The bricks are fallen down, we will build with hewn stone, the sycamores are cut down, we will change to cedars”?
I am not ambitious to dress stones, to renew forts, nor to match my value in action, against their ability to catch up with arrested prosperity.
I am not like them, indefatigable, but if you are a god you will not discriminate against me.
Yet—if you may fulfil none but prayers dressed as gifts in return for your gifts—disregard the request."
TO WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS ON TAGORE,"It is made clear by the phrase, even the mood—by virtue of which he says the thing he thinks—that it pays, to cut gems even in these conscience-less days; but the jewel that always outshines ordinary jewels, is your praise. [Pg 9]"
HE MADE THIS SCREEN,"not of silver nor of coral, but of weatherbeaten laurel.
Here, he introduced a sea uniform like tapestry; here, a fig-tree; there, a face; there, a dragon circling space— designating here, a bower; there, a pointed passion-flower."
TALISMAN,"Under a splintered mast, torn from ship and cast near her hull, a stumbling shepherd found embedded in the ground, a sea-gull of lapis lazuli, a scarab of the sea, with wings spread— curling its coral feet, parting its beak to greet men long dead. [Pg 10]"
BLACK EARTH,"Openly, yes, with the naturalness of the hippopotamus or the alligator when it climbs out on the bank to experience the sun, I do these things which I do, which please no one but myself.
Now I breathe and now I am sub- merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object in view was a renaissance; shall I say the contrary?
The sediment of the river which encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used to it, it may remain there; do away with it and I am myself done away with, for the patina of circumstance can but enrich what was there to begin with.
This elephant skin which I inhabit, fibred over like the shell of the coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light can filter—cut into checkers by rut upon rut of unpreventable experience— it is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the hairy toed.
Black but beautiful, my back is full of the history of power.
Of power?
What is powerful and what is not?
My soul shall never be cut into by a wooden spear; through- out childhood to the present time, the unity of life and death has been expressed by the circumference described by my trunk; nevertheless, I perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after all; and I am on my guard; external poise, it [Pg 11] has its centre well nurtured—we know where—in pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where?
My ears are sensitized to more than the sound of the wind.
I see and I hear, unlike the wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made to see and not to see; to hear and not to hear; that tree trunk without roots, accustomed to shout its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact by who knows what strange pressure of the atmosphere; that spiritual brother to the coral plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light becomes a nebulous green.
The I of each is to the I of each, a kind of fretful speech which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is?
Black earth preceded by a tendril?
It is to that phenomenon the above formation, translucent like the atmosphere—a cortex merely— that on which darts cannot strike decisively the first time, a substance needful as an instance of the indestructibility of matter; it has looked at the electricity and at the earth- quake and is still here; the name means thick.
Will depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no beautiful element of unreason under it? [Pg 12]"
"“HE WROTE THE HISTORY BOOK,” IT SAID","There!
You shed a ray of whimsicality on a mask of profundity so terrific that I have been dumbfounded by it oftener than I care to say.
The book?
Titles are chaff.
Authentically brief and full of energy, you contribute to your father’s legibility and are sufficiently synthetic.
Thank you for showing me your father’s autograph."
AT THE FOOT OF THE RAINBOW,"Hid by the august foliage and fruit of the grape vine, twine your anatomy round the pruned and polished stem, chameleon.
Fire laid upon an emerald as long as the Dark King’s massy one, could not snap the spectrum up for food as you have done. [Pg 13]"
REINFORCEMENTS,"The vestibule to experience is not to be exalted into epic grandeur.
These men are going to their work with this idea, advancing like a school of fish through still water—waiting to change the course or dismiss the idea of movement, till forced to.
The words of the Greeks ring in our ears, but they are vain in comparison with a sight like this.
The pulse of intention does not move so that one can see it, and moral machinery is not labelled, but the future of time is determined by the power of volition."
ROSES ONLY,"You do not seem to realise that beauty is a liability rather than an asset—that in view of the fact that spirit creates form we are justified in supposing that you must have brains.
For you, a symbol of the unit, stiff and sharp, conscious of surpassing by dint of native superiority and liking for everything self-dependent, anything an ambitious civilisation might produce: for you, unaided to attempt through sheer reserve, to confute presumptions resulting from observation, is idle.
You cannot make us think you a delightful happen-so.
But rose, if you are brilliant, it is not because your petals are the without-which-nothing of pre-eminence.
You would look, minus thorns—like a what-is-this, a mere peculiarity.
They are not proof against a worm, the elements, or mildew but what about the predatory hand?
What is brilliance without co-ordination?
Guarding the infinitesimal pieces of your mind, compelling audience to the remark that it is better to be forgotten than to be remembered too violently, your thorns are the best part of you. [Pg 14]"
"NONCHALANCE IS GOOD, AND","really, it is not the business of the gods to bake clay pots.
They did not do it in this instance.
A few revolved upon the axes of their worth as if excessive popularity might be a pot; they did not venture the profession of humility.
The polished wedge that might have split the firmament was dumb.
At last it threw itself away and falling down, conferred on some poor fool, a privilege.
Taller by the length of a conversation of five hundred years than all the others, there was one, whose tales of what could never have been actual— were better than the haggish, uncompanionable drawl of certitude; his by- play was more terrible in its effectiveness than the fiercest frontal attack.
The staff, the bag, the feigned inconsequence of manner, best bespeak that weapon, self protectiveness."
THE FISH,"wade through black jade.
Of the crow-blue mussel shells, one keeps adjusting the ash heaps; opening and shutting itself like an injured fan.
The barnacles which encrust the side of the wave, cannot hide there for the submerged shafts of the [Pg 15] sun, split like spun glass, move themselves with spotlike swift- ness into the crevices— in and out, illuminating the turquoise sea of bodies.
The water drives a wedge of iron through the iron edge of the cliff, whereupon the stars, pink rice grains, ink bespattered jelly-fish, crabs like green lilies and submarine toadstools, slide each on the other.
All external marks of abuse are present on this defiant edifice— all the physical features of ac- cident—lack of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns and hatchet strokes, these things stand out on it; the chasm side is dead.
Repeated evidence has proved that it can live on what cannot revive its youth.
The sea grows old in it. [Pg 16]"
MY APISH COUSINS,"winked too much and were afraid of snakes.
The zebras, supreme in their abnormality; the elephants with their fog-colored skin and strictly practical appendages were there, the small cats and the parrakeet— trivial and humdrum on examination, destroying bark and portions of the food it could not eat.
I recall their magnificence, now not more magnificent than it is dim.
It is difficult to recall the ornament, speech, and precise manner of what one might call the minor acquaintances twenty years back; but I shall never forget—that Gilgamesh among the hairy carnivora—that cat with the wedge-shaped, slate-gray marks on its forelegs and the resolute tail, astringently remarking: “They have imposed on us with their pale, half fledged protestations, trembling about in inarticulate frenzy, saying it is not for all of us to understand art, finding it all so difficult, examining the thing as if it were something inconceivably arcanic, as symmetrically frigid as something carved out of chrysopras or marble—strict with tension, malignant in its power over us and deeper than the sea when it proffers flattery in exchange for hemp, rye, flax, horses, platinum, timber and fur.” [Pg 17]"
WHEN I BUY PICTURES,"or what is closer to the truth, when I look at that of which I may regard myself as the imaginary possessor, I fix upon that which would give me pleasure in my average moments: the satire upon curiosity, in which no more is discernible than the intensity of the mood; or quite the opposite—the old thing, the medi- æval decorated hat box, in which there are hounds with waists diminishing like the waist of the hour-glass and deer, both white and brown, and birds and seated people; it may be no more than a square of parquetry; the literal biography perhaps—in letters stand- ing well apart upon a parchment-like expanse; or that which is better without words, which means just as much or just as little as it is understood to mean by the observer—the grave of Adam, prefigured by himself; a bed of beans or artichokes in six varieties of blue; the snipe-legged hiero— glyphic in three parts; it may be anything.
Too stern an intellectual emphasis, i- ronic or other—upon this quality or that, detracts from one’s enjoyment; it must not wish to disarm anything; nor may the approved tri- umph easily be honoured—that which is great because something else is small.
It comes to this: of whatever sort it is, it must make known the fact that it has been displayed to acknowledge the spiritual forces which have made it; and it must admit that it is the work of X, if X produced it; of Y, if made by Y.
It must be a voluntary gift with the name written on it. [Pg 18]"
PICKING AND CHOOSING,"Literature is a phase of life: if one is afraid of it, the situation is irremediable; if one approaches it familiarly, what one says of it is worthless.
Words are constructive when they are true; the opaque allusion—the simulated flight upward—accomplishes nothing.
Why cloud the fact that Shaw is selfconscious in the field of sentiment but is otherwise re- warding? that James is all that has been said of him but is not profound?
It is not Hardy the distinguished novelist and Hardy the poet, but one man “interpreting life through the medium of the emotions.” If he must give an opinion, it is permissible that the critic should know what he likes.
